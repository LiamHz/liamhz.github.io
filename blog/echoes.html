<p><em>2020/12/14</em></p>
<p>Murakami's novel, Norwegian Wood, is about all the different ways a
relationship can be broken and beautiful.</p>
<p>Toru, the 19 y/o protagonist, goes on countless long walks with Naoko
and over time they fall in love with each other. But Naoko's past trauma
keeps the two from spending time together. At first, Toru tries to cope
with this by sleeping with girls he barely knows, and then by abstaining
from sex all together. Months later he meets another girl who he falls
in love with, but he's unable to open up to her because a part of him
still lives in the past with Naoko.</p>
<p>I'm still recovering from breaking up with my ex. We were together
for two years, and split because I moved across the continent for
university while she stayed behind to finish her last year of high
school.</p>
<p>Unlike Toru and Naoko, we were able to have a wonderful relationship
together. I feel like that's supposed to make moving on easier - but if
anything it's made things harder.</p>
<p>I miss showering with her, cooking with her, and doing small things
to make her eyes light up.</p>
<p>I miss the long walks, the days laying in bed together doing nothing,
and the late nights talking on Zoom - always feeling like we were on the
same wavelength.</p>
<p>I miss the way she held me and made me feel like everything was
okay.</p>
<p>Since we broke up, I've had a few opportunities to have casual sex
with people, but I passed on all of them. I thought that my experience
with this would be like Toru's, that it'd feel empty. I don't like the
idea of treating people like a game that I solve for sex.</p>
<p><em>"I know that's what people say - you'll get over it. I'd say it,
too. But I know it's not true. Oh, you'll be happy again, never fear.
But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because
something in the person reminds you of them."</em></p>
