<h1>Why I'm Leaving Tech to Pursue Art</h1>
<p>Today, I left my job at a tech startup to study art full time.</p>
<p>I've spent 100s of hours the past 6 months drawing, and I'm eager to
go all-in. I'm planning to apply to Sheridan's animation undergrad
program in February, and have been busy preparing a portfolio for it.
Here's some of my recent work, and a <a

<p>In middle-school I competed in Canadian nationals for the board game
Go, and gave up on my dreams on going pro when AI defeated the world
champion.</p>
<p>In the 7 years since then, the thing that has remained constant in my
life is programming. I grew up building AI and computer graphics
projects for fun. I skipped class in high school to work at startups,
and haven’t stopped since then.</p>
<p>I worked on early versions of Midjourney in September of 2021. I'm
aware of the irony of pursuing an art career now.</p>
<p>I've really enjoyed these years, but I want to explore more of what
life has to offer.</p>
<p>I don't enjoy working in tech anymore. I'm good at it, am compensated
well, and the job is fairly painless. But when I started my first
full-time job two years ago, I thought "is this really what the rest of
my life will be like? churning out code to solve problems I don't care
about?" and that feeling never quite went away.</p>
<p>I've met many people who really enjoy their jobs, both engineers and
founders. I'm happy for them, but it's not a good fit for me.</p>
<p>I've also met many young people in tech who feel dissatisfied. Many
go through their career attempting to...</p>
<p>Earn as much money as possible, with the hope of</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding happiness through wealth</li>
<li>Retiring by age 30</li>
</ul>
<p>Found a startup, with the hope of</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating meaningful impact on the world</li>
<li>Becoming someone both themselves and others will admire</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money</strong>: I grew up poor, but I don’t particularly care
about making money. Beyond paying for rent and groceries I don’t have
many material desires. The past two years I worked at an AI hedge fund
in San Francisco, found myself surrounded by millionaires, and saw that
they weren't notably happier than my broke college friends. I really
enjoy creating things, and know that this will be true for the next few
decades, so working a soulless job to retire early doesn't appeal to
me.</p>
<p><strong>Founder</strong>: I need to learn more, and experience more
of the world before I’m capable of bringing a meaningful vision of the
world into reality. The problems I’m currently able to solve (CRMs,
tools for developers etc) aren't problems that I care about.</p>
<p>I also want to get out of the bubble I currently live in and
experience new ways of living.</p>
<p>I've been immersed in tech since I started high school. It’s shaped
what I value in myself and others (raw analytical thinking), what I
think about (abstract issues and systems), and how I think about these
things (optimizing for outcomes).</p>
<p>I think there’s a lot of merit to the "tech way of life". But I also
want to try living with different values (kindness and creativity),
think about different things (history, culture, and art), and change how
I think about these things (emotions and aesthetics).</p>
<p>To make a successful career change, you have to go all-in, rather
than just chipping away in the evenings. The worst case with this
approach is that I become really good at something I love, don't enjoy
the industry, and go back to my previous career for money.</p>
<p>Like everybody, I grew up with a secret unspoken belief that way deep
down I was different from everyone else. That I would go on to achieve
great things with my life. I’m 20 years old, and if the rest of my 20s
went by in a blur of startups and ever increasing salary -- I’d feel
like I had wasted my potential.</p>
