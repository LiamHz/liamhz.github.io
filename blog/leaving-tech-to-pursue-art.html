<h1>Why I Left Tech to Pursue Art</h1>
<p>Today, I left my job at a tech startup to study art full time.</p>
<p>I've spent 100s of hours the past 6 months drawing, and I'm eager to
go all-in. I'm planning to apply to Sheridan's animation undergrad
program in February, and have been busy preparing a portfolio for it.
Here's some of my recent work, and a <a

<p><img

<p>In middle-school I competed in Canadian nationals for the board game
Go, and gave up on my dreams on going pro when AI defeated the world
champion.</p>
<p>In the 7 years since then, the thing that has remained constant in my
life is programming. I grew up building AI and computer graphics
projects for fun. I skipped class in high school to work at startups. I
worked on early versions of Midjourney in September of 2021. I'm aware
of the irony of pursuing an art career now.</p>
<p>I've really enjoyed these years, but I want to explore more of what
life has to offer.</p>
<p>I don't enjoy working in tech anymore. I'm good at it, am compensated
well, and the job is fairly painless. But when I started my first
full-time job two years ago, I thought "is this really what the rest of
my life will be like? churning out code to solve problems I don't care
about?" and that feeling never quite went away.</p>
<p>I've met many people who really enjoy their jobs, both engineers and
founders. I'm happy for them, but it's not a good fit for me.</p>
<p>I've also met many young people in tech who feel dissatisfied. Many
go through their career attempting to...</p>
<p>Earn as much money as possible, with the hope of</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding happiness through wealth</li>
<li>Retiring by age 30</li>
</ul>
<p>Found a startup, with the hope of</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating meaningful impact on the world</li>
<li>Becoming someone both themselves and others will admire</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Money</strong>: I grew up poor, but I don't particularly care
about making money. Beyond paying for rent and groceries I don’t have
many material desires. The past two years I worked at an AI hedge fund
in San Francisco, found myself surrounded by millionaires, and saw that
they weren't notably happier than my broke college friends. I really
enjoy creating things, and know that this will be true for the next few
decades, so working a job I don't enjoy to retire early doesn't appeal
to me.</p>
<p><strong>Founder</strong>: I need to learn more, and experience more
of the world before I’m capable of bringing a meaningful vision of the
world into reality. The problems I’m currently able to solve (CRMs,
tools for developers etc) aren't problems that I care about. I'd much
rather tell stories that inspire people and bring a smile to the people
I’m close to.</p>
<p>I also want to get out of the bubble I currently live in and
experience new ways of living.</p>
<p>I've been immersed in tech since I started high school. It’s shaped
what I value in myself and others (raw analytical thinking), what I
think about (abstract issues and systems), and how I think about these
things (optimizing for outcomes).</p>
<p>I think there’s a lot of merit to the "tech way of life". But I also
want to try living with different values (kindness and creativity),
think about different things (history, culture, and art), and change how
I think about these things (emotions and aesthetics).</p>
<p>These things aren't incompatible with working in tech, but they won't
be the values held by most of your peers.</p>
<p>I've known that I wanted to leave for some time now, but being able
to point towards what you want more of in the world is much better than
complaining.</p>
<p>In April of 2022 I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/XbmVKmAA2XU">an
interview</a> with a storyboard artist at Riot Games. He talks about how
he holed up in Europe for a year to focus everything on improving, and
his progress was amazing.</p>
<p>For years I had enjoyed making creative tech projects, but this
interview was the first time I felt that art, without the tech side, was
something I could get better at. All it would take would be countless
hours of practice.</p>
<p>Getting home from a long day of work, and readying myself to draw for
3 hours, knowing that all the art I'd make wouldn't be close to my
standards was a challenging experience. It was the first time I was
diving into a non-STEM area in years, and being confronted with my lack
of skill day in and day out was daunting.</p>
<p>But I enjoyed the challenged, and loved every moment of making
art!</p>
<p><img src="../img/art-home-school/figures-gg-bridge.jpg" /></p>
<p>^ some figures I made two weeks after I started drawing</p>
<p>I also read <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6342111-starting-point">a
collection of essays</a> by Hayao Miyazaki, and one passage changed the
views I had on creating art being largely pointless, due to the deluge
of it that social media surrounds us with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing when creating art is that you know what you
want to say with it. There are innumerable examples of people making
films with a very high level of technique, but only a very fuzzy idea of
what they really want to say. When people who know what they want to say
make films with a low level of technique, we greatly appreciate the
films because there is really something to them.</p>
<p>When young, nearly all of us want to be taken seriously, as soon as
possible. Perhaps because of this we tend to overemphasize
technique.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even while surrounded by a flood of lifeless mediocre art, we still
need to drink a good glass of water once in while.</p>
<p>I want to create animated films, comics, and stories that are
refreshing -- that inspire people to change their life for the better,
or that just bring a smile to their face.</p>
<p>Leaving a successful career might be unwise, but I think that to make
a successful career change, you have to go all-in, rather than just
chipping away in the evenings. The worst case outcome with me leaving my
job to study art full-time is that I become really good at something I
love, I don't enjoy working in the art industry, and I go back to my
previous career.</p>
<p>Like everybody, I grew up with a secret unspoken belief that way deep
down I was different from everyone else. That I would go on to achieve
great things with my life. I'm 20 years old, and if the rest of my 20s
went by in a blur of startups and ever increasing salary -- I'd feel
like I had wasted my potential.</p>

amounted to nothing" - Soul, Pixar</p>
