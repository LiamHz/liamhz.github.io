<h1 id="taking-ideas-seriously">Taking Ideas Seriously</h1>
<p>It’s easy to be exposed to a new idea and think “huh, that’s really interesting”.</p>
<p>And a week later you’re the same person.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was talking with some friends about how I wanted to do a gap year. I wasn’t enjoying or growing much from university, and I was confidant that I’d get more out of life in the real world… but I continued to attend classes. At this point, a gap year was just an “interesting idea”, something that I might think about every now and then, but wasn’t going to act on.</p>
<p>Then, I moved out of my university’s residence hall to live with 27 other young and driven people in New Mexico. Like before, I talked with the people around me about how I was thinking of doing a gap year, and they nodded their heads. But these people inspired me, and I started taking the idea seriously. I narrowed down on my reasons for wanting to do a gap year, tried to poke holes in my own thinking, and then fixed those holes. Doing a gap year wasn’t just an “interesting idea” anymore.</p>
<p>And then I did more than take a gap year, I dropped out.</p>
<p>By taking the idea seriously, I spent enough time to arrive at what felt like a solid understanding and was confident enough in the idea to follow it to its consequences.</p>
<p>It’s easy to stumble upon interesting ideas, you just have to read and talk to more people. So how do you take ideas seriously?</p>
<p>Ideas are like skills, their strength compounds with the amount of time you put into them. Spending time by myself without people / music / podcasts / work is when I’m able to develop and sharpen an idea. I’ll often find my mind empty while walking after trying to take an idea seriously, and then a few minutes I’ll have a small “aha!” moment. Spending time on ideas and being patient with them is how I’ve been able to take them seriously.</p>
<p>If the concept of taking ideas seriously is interesting to you, then spend the time mulling it over until you’ve changed in some way. And maybe you’ll find that this concept isn’t actually that impactful - but at least you’ll have reached a sense of understanding this idea that goes beyond “huh, that’s really interesting”.</p>
