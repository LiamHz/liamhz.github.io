<h1>A Week of SF Parties and Algoraves</h1>
<p>Every night for the past week I've gone out with friends or to a
party. Normally I stay inside and work on art and music; the past few
days have been refreshing.</p>
<p>Hedonism week overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday: Kanye themed house party</li>
<li>Sunday: Watching the new Batman film</li>
<li>Monday: Watching Bojack Horseman season 1</li>
<li>Tuesday: Rock climbing with a new group of friends, then talking
till 1am</li>
<li>Wednesday: Hot pot with Toronto friends, then listening to Donda 2
at my place</li>
<li>Thursday: Algorave and midnight burritos</li>
<li>Friday: Birthday party, then 3am city wandering</li>
<li>Saturday: Birthday party, midnight burritos, then algorave till
late</li>
<li>Sunday: Dinner party with Toronto friends</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been fun. So many memorable experiences in just a week.</p>
<p>It's been neighborly. I've met more people than I normally would in a
month, and made friends that'll be part of my life beyond this week.</p>
<p>It's been exhausting. The streets of SF are magical at night with
friends, but man was not made to fall asleep at 5am.</p>
<p>It's been subsuming. I haven't made art of music the past week. I
haven't taken much time to step back and think or journal.</p>
<p><strong>Scattered thoughts</strong> The events and people were
wonderful, but I'd still like to be productive outside of work every
week. I need to find some balance.</p>
<p>I want to work on music and art with more people</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm following up with some people I met to do weekly art nights
together</li>
<li>I'm hoping that the <a
href="https://liamhinzman.com/blog/interact-application">Interact
Fellowship</a> is a great place to meet more people my age who are
thoughtful</li>
<li>Masker-spaces like <a
href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge">Noisebridge</a>
could be a great place to find people with more experience to
collaborate with</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately I've been trying to meet people outside of the general "young
startup people" crowd. Interested to see if the types of people I meet
continues to shift towards hackers and algorithmic artists.</p>
<p>Serendipity with a bit of intention will shape my social circle in
this city.</p>
<p><strong>People I met and talked to for &gt;5 minutes this
week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Victor. Improved his dating profile</li>
<li>Alex Bricken. Minerva and generative art</li>
<li>Brando. Kanye, fashion, art, music, and stemplayers</li>
<li>Wayde. Connected over the culture shock that follows shortly after
dropping out and working for the first time</li>
<li>Katt. Shared our love for Kanye, then traded thoughts on
meaning</li>
<li>Brandon. Monologued on the benefits of Web3 for 15 minutes straight,
and finished with "you're a great listener"</li>
<li>Theresa and Allie. V4 rock-climbers</li>
<li>Wesley. Convinced him that skateboarding might be the solution to
his dissatisfaction with work</li>
<li>Shrav. Talked about life after of tech; potential futures in art and
cooking</li>
<li>Berni. Talked about his ML time-series research, and my work at
Numerai</li>
<li>Peggy. VR @ Facebook. Thinking of leaving to go build the metaverse
on her own</li>
<li>Luella. Talked through her mid-life tech art existential crisis</li>
<li>Avi. Indie game dev, gonna go find him at GDC next week</li>
<li>Char. Live shader performer at algorave, she's so cool. Told me to
join AVClub SF</li>
<li>Vincent. Played We're Not Really Strangers in a group. Jughead-like
thoughtful moodiness</li>
<li>Aboli. Civil engineer in the streets. Weeb when discrete</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be hanging out with four of these people next week :)</p>
