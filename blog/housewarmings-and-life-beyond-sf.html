<h1>Housewarmings, and life beyond sf</h1>
<p>I invited 14 friends to my housewarming dinner party, and then spent
the next few hours dealing with the dire consequences of my actions.</p>
<p>Cooking enough greek-style chicken and potatoes for over a dozen
people was a mission, and I had to go through my neighbors door-to-door
to get enough chairs to seat everyone, but in the end the night was a
ton of fun: dinner, pico park puzzle solving then a smash tournament on
the switch, a ridiculous game of mafia, and then good vibes and talking
until late.</p>
<p><img src="../img/house-warming-double-living-room.png" /></p>
<p>Two days later I went to a friend's housewarming, and was amazed by
her social group. They're almost all in their late 20s,
post-rat(ionalist) smart, have research jobs at high-status labs like
OpenAI / Deepmind / Anthropic, and make throwaway comments about how
their research work is impactful in an EA way that everybody nods their
head in agreement with.</p>
<p>I'm jealous of the friends she's made, since I'm her age, and I feel
like the people I'm close to in SF is much more along the lines of young
20s people who have jobs at random startups, and aren't outlier levels
of smart or ambitious.</p>
<p>Which all goes to show how mimetic I still am. All it takes for me to
start questioning my life is hanging with a different crowd of people. I
was on her path of career-oriented AI / EA / post-rat person for the
past few years, and chose against that to explore what life and people
have to offer beyond the church of tech twitter.</p>
<p>I've found a few friends, and I enjoy parts of them beyond what fits
the startup grind and post-rat mold, but SF whispers to them "you should
be giving your entire self to startups". Friends who loved both culinary
arts and tech were forced, financially and mimetically, to reserve the
former for a future life.</p>
<p>I'm haven't lived long enough in New York / Boston / Austin / LA to
know what they whisper, but I feel like SF's been in my ear for long
enough.</p>
