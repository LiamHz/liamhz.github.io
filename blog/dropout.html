<p>I went to university for three reasons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To meet curious, driven, and kind people who were my own age</li>
<li>To give myself time to explore intellectually</li>
<li>To relax and enjoy life</li>
</ol>
<p>After my first two months of classes, I realized that university wasn’t the right place for me. Nobody there was driven to do anything outside of coursework - and after talking to a few Ivy League undergrads at <a href="https://school2point0.com/">School 2.0</a> (the group house I’ve been living at for the past two months) it seems like that this is a problem that affects all schools to varying degrees.</p>
<p>I’ll have less time to explore intellectually now that I’ll be working full-time as a developer - but I’ll enjoy life a lot more. University classes, prep work, and assignments were taking me 25 hours a week; work will take me ~45 hours a week. There’s a 20 hour difference here, but I was getting close to nothing out of my time spent doing “university stuff”, and I’m hoping that I’ll grow from and enjoy the work I do now. Now I get to end the tutorial levels of life and start the real thing. What I work on, learn, and think about is now up to me - everything in my life that matters is now in my control, and that’s really exciting to me.</p>
<p>Finally, my time at School 2.0 made me realize that I can find people that are better than any educational institution could give me. The people here are curious, driven, kind, fun, and inspire me to be a better person. I want to make lifelong friends, not “university friends” and I think that I can create this environment for myself in the real world.</p>
