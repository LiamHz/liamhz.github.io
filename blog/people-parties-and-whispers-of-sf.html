<h1>People, Parties, and the Whispers of SF</h1>
<p>2 dozen, new people I talked to<br />
1 dozen, house parties I went to<br />
Â½ dozen, new friends I've made</p>
<p><img src="../img/2022-03-house-parties.png" /></p>
<p>Ever since I decided that I wanted my identity to grow beyond just
work towards art and music, I've felt a growing sense of disconnect from
most (young) people I meet in SF. I've gotten much better at knowing
people outside of the usual stories they tell about themselves --
"what've you been into lately?" is a favorite questions of mine, but
outside of raising fat VC rounds the only aspirations (most) people have
are those that they aren't currently working towards realizing in any
form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'd like to do climate research after I sell my crypto
startup"<br />
"What've you been learning / reading / researching about that?"<br />
"I haven't had time to do any of that. Too busy with work."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as soon as I let others lead the conversation, it goes back to
which startup just raised a Series A, what crypto community is hot right
now, or the latest in theoretical AI alignment research.</p>
<p>But I'm not throwing in the towel yet!</p>
<p>In 2020, I went to university for a month, and left as soon as I was
sure that I wouldn't want to become close friends with or date anyone
there.</p>
<p>I don't want to give up and leave SF before I've given it a chance,
while also making the most of my time here.</p>
<p>This month, I've been put much more effort into making close friends.
Going to parties, becoming an honorary housemate at a group house,
hosting dinners at my place, going to concerts and rock climbing with
others, and drinking enough caffeine to stay productive in my 9 to 5
despite staying up to 3am talking with newly made friends.</p>
<p>I've made quite a few friends, but in the process of doing so I've
been surprised by how few (young) people I meet attempt to understand
paths of life that aren't travelling towards being a founder. It seems
as though the city whispers to everyone "you should be giving your
entire self to startups" -- and people who once dreamt of working as an
engineer and chef have been forced, both financially and mimetically, to
reserving the latter for another life.</p>
<p>Sometimes the city will get into my head. I'll be at a party with a
bunch of people in their late 20s who have research jobs at high-status
labs like OpenAI / Deepmind / Anthropic, or amongst a crowd of founders
raising at a &gt;$100 million valuation for their companies they started
less than a year. I'll start to grow jealous, and my self-esteem will
falter.</p>
<p>It won't be until I sit alone with my thoughts that I'll snap out of
it and realize that the lives of these people I respect is no longer the
life I want to live.</p>
<p>I haven't travelled enough to know what New York / Boston / Austin /
LA would whisper if I lived there, but I feel like SF's been in my ear
for long enough.</p>
<p>Apart from live music. Musicians can keep whispering to me in this
city.</p>
