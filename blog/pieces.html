          <h1>Little Pieces of Living</h1>
          <p>2020-12-16</p>
<p>For the past two months I lived with 27 people in New Mexico.</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw a sky full of stars for the first time in a decade</li>
<li>I lived with great people I had never known before</li>
<li>I dropped out of university</li>
<li>I climbed a mountain</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things were new to me. And now it’s over.</p>
<p>None of those pieces of the past are as real as the present moment: me, sitting on a couch in SF. I hear cars drive by, my keyboard clacking, and a car alarm going off. All of these things feel more real than all of the crazy, life-changing experience I just lived through.</p>
<p>I’m a bit sad that I’m not still living in New Mexico. I can’t walk outside and see mountains in my backyard, or have an adorable dog named Nala run into the house and jump on me.</p>
<p>But these past two months I <em>lived</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was in awe of the night sky</li>
<li>I was inspired by every one of my housemates</li>
<li>I was terrified when I dropped out of college</li>
<li>I climbed a mountain!</li>
</ul>
<p>And I can choose to feel alive now, in all of these little pieces of living:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m working at Numerai, one of the coolest companies I know of</li>
<li>I’m living in a new city that I get to see with fresh eyes</li>
<li>I’m sitting on a couch in SF</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere - be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.”</em></p>
