# Why I Dropped Out After Two Months
I went to university for three reasons

1. To meet curious, driven, and kind people who were my own age
2. To give myself time to explore intellectually
3. To relax and enjoy life

After my first two months of classes, I realized that university wasn't the right place for me. Nobody there was driven to do anything outside of coursework - and after talking to a few Ivy League undergrads at [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com/) (the group house I've been living at for the past two months) it seems like that this is a problem that affects all schools to varying degrees.

I'll have less time to explore intellectually now that I'll be working full-time as a developer - but I'll enjoy life a lot more. University classes, prep work, and assignments were taking me 25 hours a week; work will take me ~45 hours a week. There's a 20 hour difference here, but I was getting close to nothing out of my time spent doing "university stuff", and I'm hoping that I'll grow from and enjoy the work I do now. Now I get to end the tutorial levels of life and start the real thing. What I work on, learn, and think about is now up to me - everything in my life that matters is now in my control, and that's really exciting to me.

Finally, my time at School 2.0 made me realize that I can find people that are better than any educational institution could give me. The people here are curious, driven, kind, fun, and inspire me to be a better person. I want to make lifelong friends, not "university friends" and I think that I can create this environment for myself in the real world.
