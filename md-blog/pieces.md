For the past two months I lived with 27 people in New Mexico.

- I saw a sky full of stars for the first time in a decade
- I lived with great people I had never known before
- I dropped out of university
- I climbed a mountain

All of these things were new to me. And now it's over.

None of those pieces of the past are as real as the present moment: me, sitting on a couch in SF. I hear cars drive by, my keyboard clacking, and a car alarm going off. All of these things feel more real than all of the crazy, life-changing experience I just lived through.

I'm a bit sad that I'm not still living in New Mexico. I can't walk outside and see mountains in my backyard, or have an adorable dog named Nala run into the house and jump on me.

But these past two months I _lived_.

- I was in awe of the night sky
- I was inspired by every one of my housemates
- I was terrified when I dropped out of college
- I climbed a mountain!

And I can choose to feel alive now, in all of these little pieces of living:

- I'm working at Numerai, one of the coolest companies I know of
- I'm living in a new city that I get to see with fresh eyes
- I'm sitting on a couch in SF

> _"Let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere - be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost."_
