# Housewarmings, and life beyond sf

I invited 14 friends to my housewarming dinner party, and then spent the next few hours dealing with the dire consequences of my actions.

Cooking enough greek-style chicken and potatoes for over a dozen people was a mission, and I had to go through my neighbors door-to-door to get enough chairs to seat everyone, but in the end the night was a ton of fun: dinner, pico park puzzle solving then a smash tournament on the switch, a ridiculous game of mafia, and then good vibes and talking until late.

Two days later I went to a friend's housewarming, and was amazed by her social group. They're almost all in their late 20s, post-rat(ionalist) smart, have research jobs at high-status labs like OpenAI / Deepmind / Anthropic, and make throwaway comments about how their research work is impactful in an EA way that everybody nods their head in agreement with.

I'm jealous of the friends she's made, since I'm her age, and I feel like the people I'm close to in SF is much more along the lines of young 20s people who have jobs at random startups, and aren't outlier levels of smart or ambitious.

Which all goes to show how mimetic I still am. All it takes for me to start questioning my life is hanging with a different crowd of people. I was on her path of career-oriented AI / EA / post-rat person for the past few years, and chose against that to explore what life and people have to offer beyond the church of tech twitter.

I've found a few friends, and I enjoy parts of them beyond what fits the startup grind and post-rat mold, but SF whispers to them "you should be giving your entire self to startups".  Friends who loved both culinary arts and tech were forced, financially and mimetically, to reserve the former for a future life.

I'm haven't lived long enough in New York / Boston / Austin / LA to know what they whisper, but I feel like SF's been in my ear for long enough.
