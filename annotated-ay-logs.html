<h2>2022.10.01 to 2022.10.05</h2>
<p>I really like these logs! They feel a lot more reflective than
usual</p>
<p>Seems like you're really busy, hope you're finding time to breathe
and touch every building in Waterloo</p>
<h1>2022.10.03</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a weird cultural dichotomy that splits people between makers
and connectors... The distinction holds elements of truth, but
ultimately feels unsatisfactory to me... That being said, I haven't been
making enough time to be creative. This is especially true because
personal relationships can feel pressing in a way that working on
AfterEffects for 4 hours may not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the last sentence here is the resolution to this "weird
dichotomy". People can, and quite often are both, but what you identify
with primarily is what you end up prioritizing.</p>
<p>Seems like you're somewhat aware of this and trying to shift from
self-identifying as connector to maker which I'm glad to see -- will
probably take a while for this to feel natural.</p>
<h1>2022.10.01</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a reason to stay more low profile is because I hate excluding
people. If you don't advertise a hangout you can be more selective about
who attends. This goes for Socratica and other life things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big agree. Weird thing is that most of the groups / communities we
hear about are by definition the ones that are less exclusive -- so it's
easy to unconsciously model our own social groups in this (lesser)
mold</p>
<h2>2022.09.27</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to build more of a machine like we're done with UW Startups
and Socratica where we don't really have to ask people to come to
events... How do I do something similar for film?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think short film club could be cool. Have people submit one short
film / YT video, watch them together, and if people have something
they've made or learnt they can give a little screening /
presentation.</p>
<h2>2022.09.25</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been planning a pseudo-curriculum for myself re:film
stuff...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never quite figured out what areas you needed to grow in to make
film / docu-journalism feel like a real career possibility were. It
seems like you should be doing mini versions of projects that you would
do on sabbatical <em>now</em>, but maybe you already are.</p>
<p>Film curriculum seems like a step in this direction. Hope you're able
to follow through on it, or find someone to help you do so. Maybe start
small (30 second film per week, quality doesn't matter) and ask JZ to
hold you accountable?</p>
<h2>2022.09.24</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading the "Early Life" section of Wikipedia pages for people I
admire is chicken soup for the soul</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way whenever I read a biography of someone I admire.
Reminds me that the important thing isn't to rush up the mountain, but
to find the right mountain to climb, and then ascend with
determination.</p>
<h2>2022.09.23</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Went dancing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell JW where one can go dance in Waterloo</p>
<h2>2022.09.22</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Chances are, these people will always be in my life - I'll let the
relationships form as they do, just by working on interesting stuff. I'd
also rather put more effort into heads down researching more on
housing/climate/policy, rather than being scattered. This feels like
character development</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed! Even if the crystal ball said you should go, having the
principle of defaulting to focus seems good. There's the bit in
Hamming's "You and Your Research" about how working with a closed door
is better for productivity, while open door is better for serendipity. I
feel like both of us already receive more serendipity than we can
handle, so trying to keep the door shut seems good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel a sense of levity tonight. It's a combination of having some
stressors relieved and dancing in the living room with JM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad</p>
