<h2>2022.09.24</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading the "Early Life" section of Wikipedia pages for people I
admire is chicken soup for the soul</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way whenever I read a biography of someone I admire.
Reminds me that the important thing isn't to rush up the mountain, but
to find the right mountain to climb, and then ascend with
determination.</p>

<p>Went dancing</p>

<p>Tell JW where one can go dance in Waterloo</p>

<p>Chances are, these people will always be in my life - I'll let the
relationships form as they do, just by working on interesting stuff. I'd
also rather put more effort into heads down researching more on
housing/climate/policy, rather than being scattered. This feels like
character development</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed! Even if the crystal ball said you should go, having the
principle of defaulting to focus seems good. There's the bit in
Hamming's "You and Your Research" about how working with a closed door
is better for productivity, while open door is better for serendipity. I
feel like both of us already receive more serendipity than we can
handle, so trying to keep the door shut seems good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel a sense of levity tonight. It's a combination of having some
stressors relieved and dancing in the living room with JM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad</p>
