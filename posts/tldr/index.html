<p><strong>If you&rsquo;ve been procrastinating for most of the day:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Accept that you won&rsquo;t do anything today, and don&rsquo;t get angry at yourself</li>
<li>Set an alarm for when you&rsquo;ll prep for bed</li>
<li>Procrastinate for the rest of the day</li>
<li>When the alarm rings pack your laptop and everything else you need for work in your backpack</li>
<li>When you wake up leave the house immediately with your backpack</li>
<li>Go to a library, caffe, or other place to GSD</li>
<li>Return home in the evening</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Context intentionality as the difference home and every other place on earth</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Home is the default place. You&rsquo;re more likely to think &ldquo;I should do something right now&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I should get XYZ done&rdquo;</li>
<li>Always work outside of home. Go to caffes, universities, libraries - as long as you haven&rsquo;t been unproductive in that place before.</li>
<li>To reinforce this mindset forbid yourself from doing anything productive at home.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pomodoro v2</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set a timer to work on something for 25 minutes, with no distractions. After the timer goes off take a 5 minute break. One cycle of this is called a pomo.</li>
<li>Every 6 pomos (3 hours) of this take a 35 minute break</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t care about doing full pomos. If it&rsquo;s 11:07 get started immediately and set a pomo.</li>
<li>If you get distracted, don&rsquo;t reset the pomo.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re in the flow, don&rsquo;t feel like you have to take a break.</li>
<li>If you finish a task in the middle of a pomo, immediately start the next task.</li>
<li>During short breaks only non-distractive stuff is allowed (i.e. email, reddit, slack are banned)</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not excited about working on anything, use an online RNG to choose your task; preventing you from choosing the easiest tasks first.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Be Strategic</strong>
Strategy is, in essence, the ability to make decisions about how to use limited resources to create relative advantages. Develop this skill by thinking in patterns and their connections and outcomes.</p>

<p>As an introvert haging out in groups drains your batteries. Only engage with people who are worth it. Don&rsquo;t make useless friends.</p>

<p>Live strategically, don&rsquo;t just think strategically. When you decide to do something put all your effort in and use the system effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Systems and Frameworks</strong>
Systems and frameworks allow you to see the bigger picture. Systems keep you productive by preventing you from being overwhelmed. Frameworks help keep your thoughts structured and find patterns.</p>

<p>Learn lots of things. Read more, research more, dig deeper into everything. Systems thinking will allow you synthesize all this information and form new connections.</p>

<p><strong>Use Systems Thinking to Find What&rsquo;s Valuable</strong>
Why is your project at work valuable? Why do some people enjoy spending time with you? Dig several levels deep into the system to find how to add value to others.</p>

<p><strong>Look for Intersections</strong>
The ability to understand complex systems allows you to find intersections between them. Practice this skill a lot.</p>

<p>Whenever you want something to work on, don&rsquo;t look for single threads. Everyone can do that. Intersecting complex systems makes you valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Everthing is a Case Study</strong>
Every life experience can be used to gain a better understanding of current systems, patterns, and interactions. Trace back through the system to find inefficiencies.</p>

<p><strong>Seek Discomfort</strong>
If you find yourself insecure about something it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t understand the system, and therefore aren&rsquo;t good at it. Learn the system and patterns that govern it.</p>

<p><strong>Your Life is a System</strong>
Reflect on your habits, patterns, and routine. and find ways to improve it.</p>
