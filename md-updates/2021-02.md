## Personal
This month at Numerai I...

- Added a new metric, [feature neutral correlation](https://forum.numer.ai/t/feature-neutral-correlation-added-to-the-tournament-site/1669), to the Numerai website. Was a fun end to end project: ranging from data pipeline changes to website UI.
- [Revamped](https://forum.numer.ai/t/updated-signals-validation-data/2040) the validation data we give for our [Signals](https://signals.numer.ai) tournament. Previously it was a static file that ended over a year ago, now it updates every week with new data, making time series methods more viable.

Played a bunch of Starcraft with my roommate (Numerai founder) and watched some films with him: Primal Fear, Safe (1995), Unforgiven, Swallow, Friday, and Memories of Murder.

Read Mistborn: The Well of Ascension.
