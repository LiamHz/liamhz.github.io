## Personal
Completed my first oncall rotation at Numerai!

Bought a nice digital piano (Roland FP30) and had a lot of fun learning different themes from films and TV shows.

Struggled with living in isolation. I'm an introvert, but going without any human interaction for a week can be rough.

Read the first 20% of Worm (7000 page Superhero novel), Existentialism is a Humanism, Mistborn: The Final Empire, and Kafka on the Shore.

Watched Violet Evergarden and The Queen's Gambit.
