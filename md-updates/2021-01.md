## Personal
This month at Numerai I...

- Broke production systems twice in three days (first time I've done this), was scared of breaking things afterwards and was less productive as a result, and finally overcame this fear, wrote post mortems, and am now much more diligent about testing my code.
- Learned a lot of Pandas while building out different things for the hedge fund's data pipeline.
- Completed my first oncall rotation.

Bought a nice digital piano (Roland FP30) and had a lot of fun learning different themes from films and TV shows.

Struggled with living in isolation. I'm an introvert, but going without any human interaction for a week can be rough.

Read the first 20% of Worm (7000 page Superhero novel), Existentialism is a Humanism, Mistborn: The Final Empire, and Kafka on the Shore.

Watched Violet Evergarden and The Queen's Gambit.
