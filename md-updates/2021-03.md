## Personal
This month at Numerai I...

- Improved our data tournament [Signals](https://signals.numer.ai). Added [cumulative correlation graphs](https://forum.numer.ai/t/signals-model-diagnostics-cumulative-correlation-graphs/2440) to users' model diagnostics, and significantly improved the [ticker map](https://forum.numer.ai/t/updated-signals-ticker-map/2239) we give to users.
- Became the "face of Signals", handling user questions / bugs / feature requests. Also hosted two [separate](https://youtu.be/WqSxacvH100) Signals community [roundtables](https://twitter.com/richardcraib/status/1372596058077937669?s=20) where I discussed new changes and fielded Q&A with users.
- Completed my first solo oncall rotation

Lived in Brooklyn with some of my New Mexico group house friends for two weeks. Went to my first rave!

Bought a electric guitar, completed JustinGuitar's 3 part beginner lessons, and learned some finger style songs (Take on Me, Nascence, Greensleeves, Do I Wanna Know).
