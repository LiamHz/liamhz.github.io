July 2020 Newsletter
====================

## Personal
- Got into Shadertoy, and through this back into graphics programming as a whole. Completed a bunch of resources on shaders and ray marching, and made a [few][171] shaders of my [own][172].
- Discovered the Demoscene, a subculture that builds demos (self-contained computer programs that produce audio-visuals), and [remade][166] my favorite demo, Intrinsic Gravity, in Shadertoy.
- Decided to move on from OpenGL and learn Vulkan. I completed [Vulkan-Tutorial][167] and (after ~40 hours) I can render a triangle!
- Wrote [Fundamentals of the Vulkan Graphics API][168] to get a better understanding of how all the pieces explained in Vulkan-Tutorial fit together. My post somehow made it to [#1 on r/Programming][169], and was [retweeted][170] by the official Vulkan Twitter account :)
