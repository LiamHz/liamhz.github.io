- [How to Be Happy][19], Luke Prog (Overview of the research on things that have a causal relationship with happiness)
- [The Doomsday Argument and the Number of Possible Observers][20], Olum (The anthropic principle implies that humans are a long-lived species)

## Books

- [The Elephant in The Brain][2], Simler and Hanson (argues that many human behaviors such as conversation, charity, and laughter are rooted in evolutionary psychology, specifically signaling of status / prestige)

### Fiction
- [Never Let Me Go][3], Ishiguro ("You don't escape or rebel against your reality if it's part of who you are, and all you've ever known. This is what makes the novel so tragic, the theme of lives that are never what they could be." - [The Guardian][4])
