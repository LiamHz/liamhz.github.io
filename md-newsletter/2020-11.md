## Personal
Dropped out of university! Wrote about why [here](https://liamhinzman.com/blog/dropout.html).

Interviewed at 4 startups ([Numerai,](numer.ai) [Reduct Video](reduct.video), [Atmos](https://www.buildatmos.com/), and [Digital Brain](http://digitalbrain.app/) - and started a 6-week contract project with Reduct Video

Read The Art of Learning and Norwegian Wood.

Had a lot of fun with the people I'm living with at [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com/) I had my first LAN party ever with them (Starcraft) and went on a road trip to the White Sands.

Built Pico with [Taylor Rogalski](https://twitter.com/tayroga) (a tool to understand how you spend time on your computer), [Truchas Bulb](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdcfWf) with [Steve Fay](https://dcxst.github.io/) (a ray marcher that renders the Mandelbulb), and a [path tracer](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WddBDl).
