- 2 tbsp of cooking oil
- 1 packet of butter chicken spice mix

## Directions
1. Mix lemon juice, yogurt, cooking oil, spice mix, and toss the chicken in it.
2. Let the chicken marinate for 1-3 hours
3. Cook rice however you want.
4. Empty the tomato paste into a bowl, fill the can with water and pour it in, and mix.
5. Toss the chicken onto a frying pan on medium heat and cook for 3 minutes.
6. Pour the tomato paste / water onto the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes on low heat.
