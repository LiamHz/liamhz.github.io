_You are what you eat_ \

## Ingredients
_See "Notes" section for items with a \*_

**Crust**

- 1 tsp of sugar
- 1 cup of warm water
- 1 packet of pizza yeast*
- 2.5 cups of bread flour*
- 2 tbsp of olive oil
- 1 tsp of salt

**Sauce**

- 1 can of tomato paste
- 3/4 cup of water
- 1/3 cup of olive oil
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- Salt to taste
- Black pepper to taste
- 1/2 tbsp of dried oregano
- 1/2 tbsp of dried basil
- 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary

**Toppings**

- Cheese (I recommend mozzarella)
- Go wild

## Directions
**Crust**

1. Preheat over to 450F.
2. In a bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water, and let it sit for 10 minutes.
3. In the same bowl, stir in flour, salt, and oil. Beat until smooth.
4. Let it sit for ~30 minutes. Make sauce now.

**Sauce**

1. Mix together the tomato paste, water, and olive oil.
2. Mix in garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and rosemary.

**Prepare the Pie**

1. Sprinkle flour onto a surface, place the dough on the surface, and roll it with a rolling pin until it's ~12 inches in diameter.
2. Transfer dough to a pan, _and only after_ spread desired toppings (sauce, cheese etc)
3. Bake for 18 minutes
4. Let pizza cool for 5 minutes

## Notes
- Many grocery stores will sell packets of yeast specifically for pizza. If you can't find one, just go for any type of dry yeast and use 1/4 ounce.
- Bread flour is ideal, but all-purpose flour will also work. Avoid cake flour.
