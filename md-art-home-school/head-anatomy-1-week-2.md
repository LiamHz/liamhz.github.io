The past year I've tried learning how to make music, play guitar, do game dev, skateboard, and render with blender -- but I didn't reach a significant level with proficiency with any of these because I kept switching between all of them.

Drawing is the first thing in a while that I believe I'll stick with and get really good at.

I improved a ton over the past week. I started using a blending stick towards the end, and the increase in shading fidelity helped me define forms a lot better.


## Monday
<div class="ahs-description">

35m drawing \
Cooked dinner and hung out with friends, but I still manage to squeeze in some time to work through the Proko tutorial on the anatomy of lips.

## Tuesday
<div class="ahs-description">

2h 25m \
Started on the [100 heads challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A_kQsxeeTE)

I've previously read the advice of [don't go to art school](https://noahbradley.com/dont-go-to-art-school/) (tl;dr 4-year undergrad programs often focus on the conceptual rather than craft side of art, and they're very expensive), but right before I went to bed I started researching a 1-year concept art school in Singapore called [FZD](https://fzdschool.com/)

I spent a lot of time this week collecting as many reviews and leaked course materials as I could. All students have to sign an NDA so it was surprisingly hard to find info. I think there's a 50% chance I travel to Asia for the first time in my life to attend FZD.

I posted some of my notes on FZD [here](https://gist.github.com/LiamHz/310516f30db73059c8f42ef1ba0e7427)

## Wednesday
<div class="ahs-description">

1h 55m \
I like how having a fixed challenge, in this case drawing 100 heads from a list of references, removes the possibility of procrastination through decision making. It's clear that the only productive thing to do right now is put pencil to paper.

Got stuck at a party that I didn't want to be at, so it was nice to be able to draw in the corner.
