Spent two hours relearning how to draw figures on an iPad. Gonna relearn how to draw heads on the iPad over the next few days

Went to my first college frat party

- Compared to tech parties, everybody is gloriously average and just wants to get drunk and talk / laugh
- I did drunk sketches of cute girls and showed them the pic as an icebreaker. Naturally led to fun conversations
