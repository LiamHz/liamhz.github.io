## Tuesday
<div class="ahs-description">

1h 5m \
Realized that I'm a lot better at controlling the bounds of these shapes then last time I attempted draw a box. Glad to see that figure drawing and head anatomy has improved my line accuracy.

Drawing ellipses feels meditative.

Boxes have a lot of room for improvement, but I'm happy that I'm able to draw from the shoulder and get their convergences to all lie within fairly small bounds.
