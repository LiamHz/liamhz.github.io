In January of this year I spent a week doing [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com/), and stopped just before the 250 boxes challenge. Feels nice to surpass past me.

## Sunday
<div class="ahs-description">

1h \
Drew a scene of Venice -- was my first time drawing for fun instead of a study, this was prompted by me watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZhLzt__lcc). I enjoyed it, and decided to buy an iPad pro. Am excited to be able to draw in high fidelity with vibrant colors in cafes.
