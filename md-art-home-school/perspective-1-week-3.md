# Perspective 1, Week 3
Week of July 18 \
8h 5m of drawing

After last week's diversion to get comfortable with drawing on the iPad, I'm back to working through [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com/)

## Tuesday
<div class="ahs-description">

1h 10m \
The reference I drew from today was actually one I drew 3 weeks ago. In the pencil/paper sketch I didn't want to shade the left half b/c I was worried I'd mess up the sketch. Comparing the two is a nice example of how I'm more willing to shade more boldly on the iPad since erasing is so much easier digitally

Not feeling too great with drawing ellipses and controlling their degree of rotation. I'll do a page or two of ellipse tables next week to brush up here
