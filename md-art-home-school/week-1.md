## Drawings

### Monday

<div class="ahs-description">

2h 30m drawing \
2h planning art home school

No better way to spend a day off work than drawing ellipses. Feeling hopeful about the progress I'll make over the next few months.

I love the idea of slowly accumulating dozens of weekly progress updates, so it's clear for myself and others to see how going from complete beginner to decent is just the result of consistent practice.

### Tuesday
<div class="ahs-description">
Today was demoralizing. Last month I had drawn lots of gesture and boxes in a small sketchbook, which I only now realized led me to rely on drawing with my wrist instead of shoulder.

</br>
</br>
Trying to draw tonight with my shoulder in a larger sketchbook felt so unnatural and I was pretty unhappy with the results.

### Wednesday
<div class="ahs-description">
Started the day by watching the videos in week 1 and 2 of [Figuary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXkHosWORUv66_H0YBErfIyIJkmBE71NR). Some review of figure drawing fundamentals (squash/stretch in torso/pelvis, capturing gesture in a few lines etc) I learned last month, and some details on shading figures.

Today was my first attempt at doing timed figure drawing (2 and 5 minutes). The time pressure helped me stress less about mistakes and just enjoy the process.

</br>
Main thing I'd like to improve on with these drawing is exaggerating the gesture to more clearly tell a story with a single figure.

</br>
</br>
Feeling a lot better at drawing in a larger sketchbook with my shoulder already.

### Thursday
<div class="ahs-description">
Watched the videos in week 3 of Figuary

Feeling more comfortable with shading figures to imply volume.

### Friday
No drawing today... was very productive at work, which made me too exhausted to do anything once I got home

### Saturday
<div class="ahs-description">
Finished watching all the videos in Figuary

Made the red pen sketches while I was on the bus, was fun to draw from life and notice the person sitting beside me watching me draw
