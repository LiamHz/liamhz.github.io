This week wasn't very productive due to an expected traumatic event that occurred Tuesday evening. Took me most of the week to get back in the groove.

Week of August 1 \
3h 14m of drawing

Another slow week for drawing progress. Most of my time got sucked up by moving out of my SF apartment, but I should start waking up early in the morning and drawing for an hour to start off the day to make sure every week is moving me forward
