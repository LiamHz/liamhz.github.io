<p>Murakami’s novel, Norwegian Wood, is about all the different ways relationships can be broken and beautiful.</p>
<p>Toru, the 19 y/o protagonist, goes on countless long walks with Naoko and over time they fall in love with each other. But Naoko is recovering from the trauma of seeing both her ex and her sister commit suicide. This keeps the two from sleeping with one another and eventually from spending time together at all, but they stay in love. Toru tries to cope with this at first by sleeping with girls he barely knows, and then by abstaining from sex all together. Months later he meets another girl who he falls in love with, but is unable to open up to her because a part of him still lives in the past with Naoko.</p>
<p>I’m still recovering from breaking up with my ex. We were together for 11 months, and we split because I moved across the continent for university while she stayed behind to finish her last year of high school. Unlike Toru and Naoko, we were able to have a wonderful relationship together. Maybe that’ll make moving on easier, but it hasn’t helped yet. I’ve had a few opportunities to have casual sex with people, but I passed on all of them because I thought that my experience with this would be like Toru’s, that it’d feel empty. I don’t like the idea of treating people like an object, a game that I solve for sex.</p>
<p>I’m worried that I won’t be able to move on, that like Toru I’ll keep myself from giving myself completely to others because I’m still thinking about my first love.</p>
<p>Toru’s relationship with Naoko is central to the book and is what has made me think the most, but it’s not the only thing that has stuck with me. Norwegian Wood also features the stories of many other relationships, and this has made me think about what I want from life.</p>
<p>For me, the past few years has been largely focused on achievement I loved building machine learning and computer graphics projects for its own sake, but there was also a part of me that thought about how these things would help my future - how it’d help get me into college or find a good job.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve dropped out and have a job I’m really happy with, I’m thinking “What now? What do I want out of life that I don’t have?”, and I think the answer is “not much”. I want to relax a little more, to enjoy life, to make stories with others, and worry about the future a little less. Mainly, I want to share life with people I care about.</p>
<p>The stories of all the different relationships in Norwegian Wood has let me see possible futures for myself: the different types of relationships I could have or people I could become.</p>
<p>Characters from the novel who are possible futures for me include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking care of people who I love but have no future</li>
<li>Sticking with people who I love despite their flaws</li>
<li>Treating others as puzzles who I solve to get companionship or sex from</li>
<li>Sleeping with the first person who is kind to me, but only being able to think about the last person I was actually in love with</li>
<li>Not loving my partner, but staying with them because I feel like I should be in a relationship with somebody</li>
<li>Using people as storytelling props, and making fun of them to cheer up others</li>
<li>Being hurt and broken inside, but only showing my happy and put together self to everyone</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything in life in a choice, and to me the most interesting ones right now are who I want to become and the types of relationships I want to have.</p>
