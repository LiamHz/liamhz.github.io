          <h1>My 2022 Reincarnation Plan</h1>
          <p>2022-01-02</p>
<p>This year I began my first full-time job at an <a href="https://twitter.com/LiamHinzman/status/1341064191688364032?s=20">AI startup hedge fund</a>, gained a ridiculous amount of programming experience and knowledge, shouldered lots of trust and responsibilities, and delivered value^tm. I put in so much time and effort to make this happen: stressing about progress, late nights hacking away, and waking up on weekends to quash bugs.</p>
<p>These were the goals I held dearest while in high school. To achieve mastery in something, be valued by peers, and to contribute to something.</p>
<p>But I don’t feel that accomplished.</p>
<p>I don’t care about what I’ve mastered, I don’t feel inspired by my co-workers, and I don’t care about what I’m contributing to.</p>
<p>Right now I’m thinking that I’ll work at Numerai until January 2023 to save some money and vest a bit of equity, and then quit to go explore and make music.</p>
<p>The thought of leaving Numerai and being unemployed fills me with dread. I’d feel like a failure if I went back to software development, but right now I don’t see any other plausible career options. It’s daunting to even think about leaving the industry I’ve been involved with, both w/r/t/ skill and time, for the past decade.</p>
<p>That being said, I’ll leave software soon.</p>
<p>I want to try on different lives like I try on clothes. I want to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, and reality to every dream.</p>
<p>I want to get good at</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Playing guitar</li>
<li>Composing music</li>
<li>3D motion graphics</li>
<li>Photography and film</li>
<li>Procedural generation</li>
<li>Things that fill me with dread: singing and dancing</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think the world needs more monodisciplinary artists, but I hope that while I’m creating I’ll get a sense of intersections that I want to explore that capitalism hasn’t created a rat race out of yet. Maybe this will be HCI research, or procedural music visualization tools, but more likely it’ll be something I can’t even conceive of yet.</p>
<p>This year I want to create more things, with the intended audience being myself, while still publishing everything. I want the authenticity, vulnerability, and experimentation that comes with not having to worry about an audience, while also being comfortable enough with myself to post publicly.</p>
<p>I like the idea of letting my work speak for itself first. Often it’s easy to talk about how I’ve started to learn something and how I find it really interesting after one week of effort, and then having gotten my hit of dopamine from external validation I stop working on that thing.</p>
<p>I want 2022 to be the year of creating art, and doing before talking.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Breaking news: Teenager realizes he doesn’t have the whole world figured out</strong></p>
<p>One issue I’ve had to grapple with while thinking about switching from tech to art is choosing what I want to do, instead of what I feel I should.</p>
<p>During my high school years I was learning all about and building AI projects. In the background there was a constant stream of thoughts from Paul Graham, Sam Altman, and Naval Ravikant being hurled at me saying that all I needed to be fulfilled was to work at, and eventually found a SaaS startup.</p>
<p>A core belief I held was that startups were one of the few things that create “impact and value” for the world, and the only thing that felt within reach for me.</p>
<p>Then the mimesis started to fall apart</p>
<p>I met high-status founders (i.e. Thiel and YC) who were building uninspired companies while raising millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Twitter and SF were overrun by crypto-evangelists who painted vague utopias of hyper-capitalism, and my entire social group got caught up in the hype and money.</p>
<p>I stopped believing in the status-systems of yore, that raising VC funding is the pinnacle of achievement, and that the Twitter tech philosopher-kings had all the answers.</p>
<p>I was left with a gnawing feeling that the world-view I had held for the past five years was flawed in some deep way that I still can’t quite pinpoint.</p>
<p>When ask myself “what’s next?”, art is what comes to mind.</p>
<p>But when I think about spending a year of my life creating art, I reflexively feel like I should crawl back to my computer and go back to creating value^tm – this will fade with time as I find more artists I admire.</p>
<p>Here’s some of the people in my new pantheon</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html">Devine Lu Linvega</a>, prolific output in art, music, tech and research</li>
<li><a href="https://rmozone.com/">Robert M Ochshorn</a>, text-interaction R&amp;D, founder of <a href="https://reduct.video/">Reduct Video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/">Szymon Kaliski</a>, breadth of experience across HCI: music, writing, design</li>
<li><a href="https://qhex.org/">Dany Qumsiyeh</a>, built some cool things, worked with him briefly at Reduct</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Some things that changed about me this year.</p>
<p>I value close friendships a lot more.</p>
<p>I learned how to be very honest with myself w/r/t my emotions.</p>
<p>Beyond rent and food, money matters very little to me. I knew this intellectually for a while, but viscerally experienced this while living with millionaires and working full-time.</p>
<p>Impact, at least in the abstract sense which can be measured by the market, doesn’t motivate me much. Becoming a better and more skilled person, and creating wonderful things does motivate me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Time for the obligatory 2022 goals section</p>
<p>I want to create more art.</p>
<p>Specifically, I want to get good at</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing guitar</li>
<li>Composing music</li>
<li>3D motion graphics</li>
<li>Photography and film</li>
<li>Procedural generation</li>
<li>Things that fill me with dread: singing and dancing</li>
</ul>
<p>Success for me would be if I publish three things, each in a different category that I think is good (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/LiamHz/atlas">proc gen terrain</a>), and three things in different categories I’m proud of (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/LiamHz/excal">rendering engine</a> + <a href="https://liamhinzman.com/blog/vulkan-fundamentals.html">article</a>).</p>
<p>I’m alright if I don’t get around to exploring all of these things, I care much more about reaching some level of proficiency and output that I’m happy with in a few of these things.</p>
<p>Measuring both effort and output seems like a good idea, so setting aside 10 hours a week to spend on any of the above areas is a goal.</p>
<p>Another way I’ll measure this is if I feel at home amongst the artists and HCI devs people in Devine Lu Linvega’s <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/">webring</a> – I’ll add myself at the end of the year, but feeling “at home” is what matters most.</p>
<p>I also want to write more. Some arbitrary numbers that sound good in my head are ≥ 1 blog post a month, and ≥ 1 journal entries / brain dumps a week.</p>
