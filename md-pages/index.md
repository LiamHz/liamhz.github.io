data at numerai
writing music (piano + guitar)
making art (algorithmic + blender + trad)

the story so far...

I played the board game go for years, and competed at canadian nationals

shortly after, alphago crushed the world champion and my career dreams. To cope I worked at AI labs during high school

went to university for a month, lived with 25 strangers in the desert, and then dropped out

joined numerai as a full-time data eng in 2020

nurturing my soul by creating
- vr games with friends
- orchestral music
- 3d art with blender
- good old fashioned sketches
- <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/LiamHinzman/status/1496168406931759110">generative art with forbidden magic
