# July, Week 3
## Monday, July 25
RC reemerged after a week of no-contact to announce that he's moved to NYC. Feel bad that both me and him have left MP -- I hope he does alright.

I had taken the day off work today, but ended up getting roped into 4 hours of work anyways. Not ideal, but freedom is only a few months away.

Watched American Psycho with JW, some thoughts:
The richness of your interior life doesn't matter much if none of that is reflected in your actions or how you treat others

Jung's concept of the shadow. Most of what I dislike about others is because I fear or dislike some part of that in myself. I see my shadows in others w/r/t stagnation, not following through on personal goals, not being interesting to others, and not having anything to say that carries meaning.

It's easier to love others as they are when I'm aware of why I instinctively judge them.

# July, Week 2
## Sunday, July 23
AY and JM flew in from Arizona, and me and JW threw together a SF adventure for them

- Dinner at New Thai Elephant
- Biked to the Palace of Fine Arts, witnessed an ethereal violinist
- Biked to a fog obscured Golden Gate Bridge, overcast and spooky stranger things vibes
- Biked back home

This whole adventure was so much fun, and I want to create a lot more memorable experiences for the people I care about over the next few months.

Am sad that JZ sat in the car reading instead of joining us. Feels like he doesn't want to mend things between us, and that this won't ever change.

Also a bit sad at not getting an invite from AY for group hiking at Big Sur or roadtripping to LA. It's probably for JZ's sake and capacity reasons.

But shared time is rare, life is short, and I've been putting in a lot of effort to spend more time together in person. Not having this reciprocated stings.

All that being said, I'm grateful for the past 9 months together and all the ways I've grown because of that. Those months matters more to me than the past week or two. Life gets busy, close friends make mistakes, and yet I will happily choose to love them regardless over and over again.

## Saturday, July 23
I finally told MP that I'll be leaving Numerai in October. After a short pause, his first response was "I'm happy for you" -- there was a bit of silence after since we didn't know what else to say, but after a minute or two we started making jokes about it while lifting at the gym.

He mentioned that he'd feel a bit bad if I was leaving to join another tech company or hedge fund, but seems quite happy for me that I'm going on sabbatical to explore art and other things.

Went to Marufuku ramen and then watched Nope with JW, MP, and BB

Having the coworker I'm closest to know that I'm leaving, and him being okay with it, makes it feel like a weight's been lifted.

## Thursday, July 21
Yesterday me and MP launched a big revamp to Numerai's internal universe. A lot of stuff broke this morning, and most of today was bringing everything back to life.

Went rock climbing with MP and JW

Played guitar for the first time in months. I sold my piano a few weeks ago, and am now feeling the itch to play some music again -- hoping that I'll end up getting good at guitar over the next few months, but we'll see where life takes me.

## Wednesday, July 20
I really respect Magnus Carlsen giving up the world chess champion title today, it's hard to do what you know is best if there's large social pressure to stay stagnant

## Tuesday, July 19
Went to the Cohere SF office with JW. Got a bit of work done, then drew for an hour. I'm able to draw heads just as well on iPad as paper now

The reference I drew from today was actually one I drew 3 weeks ago. In the pencil/paper sketch I didn't want to shade the left half b/c I was worried I'd mess up the sketch. Comparing the two is a nice example of how I'm more willing to shade more boldly on the iPad since erasing is so much easier digitally

Went to a TKS dinner party. To a former TKS director: "I'm leaving tech for a bit to go study art" -- "Cool! Like Paul Graham"

I want to become the Hayao Miyazaki of video games. A medium and genre defining prolific creator.

This is what I want my art practice to eventually lead to, but I’m in no rush to get there. 

The plan is to still study art, but I definitely want to play some games published by Annapurna Interactive (the A24 of video games), experimental interactive fiction with unique art styles and mechanics, and participate in a game jam every other month or so

## Monday, July 18
I do leg day once a quarter \
Today was leg day with JW \
Pain

Sold my OP-1 to a guy off Facebook marketplace for $800 in cash. Was stressful having a sketchy guy had me a wad of $100 bills, but we survived
 
# July, Week 2
## Sunday, July 17
Drew for 90 minutes in Delores park with JW. Getting back up to speed with drawing heads on the iPad

Met up with two of JW's friends from last night's party. One of the two was "the hot girl" from the party -- I have a thing for skinny asian girls with Calvin Klein bras now -- but when she talked while sober I went "oh noes". It's weird how many people who seem great at a remove aren't that interesting or personable when you get to know them.

Went to an art book fair. I really enjoyed <a href="https://paragon-books.com/products/sketchbook-6">Felicia Chao's</a> work, but apart from that I was surprised that most of the book vendors didn't have a high degree of skill

Went rock climbing, then ate at Mensho's, my favorite ramen joint

## Saturday, July 16
I beat my first song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild")! Has been a big goal of mine the past month -- slowly reaffirming my belief that I can achieve anything I want to in life.

Other goals I have that are self-belief affirming

- Ollie up a curb
- Creating a short animated music video
- Creating an original piano + guitar arrangement of a favorite song and uploading to YouTube

Spent two hours relearning how to draw figures on an iPad. Gonna relearn how to draw heads on the iPad over the next few days

Went to a college frat party with JW, my first!

- "What's been on your mind lately? Where's your head been at?" is a great conversation opener with guys, but doesn't seem to work well as often with gals.
- Compared to tech parties, everybody is gloriously average and just wants to get drunk and talk / laugh
- I did drunk sketches of cute girls and showed them the pic as an icebreaker. Naturally led to fun conversations

## Friday, July 15
Got a 12.9 inch iPad Pro with a pencil! Am very excited to be able to draw digitally: color, easy undo, and layers

JW arrived at my place in the evening, he's gonna be staying with me for the next week

## Thursday, July 14
DH invited me to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFRdoYfZYUY">Hania Rani</a>, one of my favorite pianists, live. For over an hour she looped and switched between three pianos -- seeing one person create all that music live was inspiring.

## Wednesday, July 13
Went to a dinner party

## Tuesday, July 12
Interviewed a candidate for Numerai. It was clear that he hasn't coded much the past two years (was promoted to manager), and right after I sent in my feedback the rest of his interviews were cancelled. Feels strange to wield this much impact over another's life.

Went to my first stand-up comedy show with MP -- very fun time, and I have so much more respect for what they do now, I couldn't imagine doing comedy improve live with so much pressure.

## Monday, July 11
Flew back from Vegas to SF. Got on the plane 5 minutes for takeoff

Talked with AY for a few hours in the evening and did a review of sorts of life since we met last November.

# July, Week 1
## TL;DR
RC's birthday in Vegas

Drew 130 boxes over 13 hours

Realized that I'm at the peak of a life that I do not want to live

## Sunday, July 10
Woke up in the Elvis suite, swam in the pool for a bit, played piano while private jet guy played saxophone, and ate breakfast served by the suite's butler.

Talked with CL while eating tacos for lunch. Was nice to hear that the casual drug usage on display at all of the Numerai parties I've been to is much more extreme than anything else he's seen while working

Drew a scene of Venice -- was my first time drawing for fun instead of a study. I enjoyed it, and decided to buy an iPad pro. Am excited to be able to draw in high fidelity with vibrant colors in any cafe.


## Saturday, July 9
In Vegas for RC's birthday party
- Private jet with live saxophone
- Front row seats at Cirque du Soleil (Michael Jackson One)
- Party at the penthouse of Westgate, the suite where Elvis used to live
- Afterparty at RT's house, interior design was what every kid dreams of

There was a dozen times tonight where in the middle of talking to someone they'd do a line of coke.

I’m on the peak of a mountain that I do not want to be on

I do not want to be around these people, talk about money, or do drugs

Met EC, got the sense she was dissatisfied with her finance job. She's like me at a similar stage in life, but more advanced in every way (salary, art skill, education level etc)

I want to live a life and be around people where I can be completely honest with what I'm thinking about and who I am.

## Friday, July 8
Played DDR for an hour and came within inches of beating a song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild")

This past week I've spent 13 hours drawing 130 boxes in an attempt to improve my skill at perspective. Normally I draw at home with music on, but tonight I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZhLzt__lcc">a video</a> suggesting that only doing drawing studies isn't the best -- a large amount of drawing what you love is great to try out different styles, apply what you've learnt in studies, and nurture your soul.

I'm gonna carve out an hour every morning to draw for fun.

## Thursday, July 7
Every other Thursday Numerai has a massage therapist come into the office and give everyone the most wonderful 30 minute massage.

Today she commented on how the shape of my back and its muscles have changed over the past month from me rock climbing.

It's strange to have someone know your body better than your mind.

## Wednesday, June 6
Really enjoying DDR. Am consistently beating the hardest songs on "Hard". Gonna try and beat a song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild") this week, which is crazy since this was on my short list of goals in life last month.

Managed to fit in 2.5 hours of drawing boxes during 5 hours of work meetings.

## Tuesday, July 5
I'm happy keeping the number of people I'm close to small, since no matter how busy life is I can always be there for them

## Monday, July 4
Broke up with Nancy two days ago. Despite not finding a life partner I still wouldn't have done anything differently. Committing to a relationship quickly when I feel a spark is what I'll continue doing in the future -- even if things go south it's alright since I'm honest throughout and feel fine breaking things off when I know it won't work out.

Numerai rented a sailboat to watch the Independence day fireworks. Out on the Bay the fireworks were so close that they filled my entire field of view.

# June, Week 5
## TL;DR
- Redesigned my website
- Terminated my lease
- [Completed perspective 1 week 1](/art-home-school/perspective-1-week-1.html)
- Played a lot of DDR
- Learned how to ollie

I feel much more emotionally well and stable than I did last year

## Sunday, July 3
Today was my ideal day: drawing, cooking, skateboarding, talking with AY, and DDR.

Thinking about how I haven't really watched any TV shows / movies, played many games, or read much fiction the past few months -- usually in pursuit of being productive in my free-time.

Letting more quality long-form art and entertainment into my life is important for inspiration. Am most interested in media with unique art styles, interaction mechanisms that enhance immersion, and worlds / characters with depth.

## Saturday, July 2
Coworked via Discord with Alex Honeycutt, the creator of the self study art curriculum I've been following the past two months.

Last week DR mentioned that he considered his attempt to self-study math the past year a failure, because there were often months where he felt intellectually isolated and didn't get anything done as a result.

It was nice talking to and co-existing with another person who left tech to pursue art. I'm gonna continue putting effort into making art friends and contributing to little corners of the internet.

## Friday, July 1
Went to In n Out with JP, talked about how he's feeling burnt as a solo founder, and my essay on why I'm doing art.

I often say "I'm doing art because I like it". There's a lot more nuance to my thoughts, and my joke response is probably indicative of some insecurity

He likes the crackhead energy of dropping everything to pursue what feels right.

"I probably won't make much money as an artists" -- he doesn't believe this to be true as long as I apply a bit of tech thinking: high agency and aiming for the heavy tail

## Thursday, June 30
Got to catch up with DH for the first time in months at the Numerai office party

- Midjourney and the future of illustrators and concept artists
- Me leaving Numerai because I'm young and want to explore more of life. Was nice to have a mentor say that my plan "makes sense"
- Him encouraging me to go to Japan / Berlin instead of holing up in Canada

Wrote [head anatomy 1 week 3 update](/art-home-school/head-anatomy-1-week-3.html)
## Wednesday, June 29
AY recently redesigned their website, which inspired me to revamp mine as well.

Chia and 100R's personal websites have been my favorite for a long time. I've borrowed their multi-column layouts and more prolific vibe for this new site.

Screenshots of my previous and redesigned website

MP told me what him and RC felt that they were missing in life, and asked what I feel I'm lacking in. I wonder if he has a hunch that I'm leaving

## Tuesday, June 28
AY's response to me feeling guilty about leaving was "I think they'd want you to leave and follow your dreams". It's a nice sentiment, but I think the subtext here is "don't you dare wuss out of this"  

This subtext was a nice push to finally email my landlord and request to terminate my lease and move out on Aug 5, the day I fly out for NYC.  

Things are in motion that cannot be undone.

## Monday, June 27
Numerai company onsite this week! Half of our team is remote -- it's nice to have everyone together.

Went to our COO's house and went on a hike, had a pool party, and ate lunch from a taco truck guy.

It was a nice day, but also good to remember that working away at a hedge fund to afford all this isn't my goal in life.

Felt guilty about having fun with coworkers, knowing that I'll soon leave and break everyone's hearts.
