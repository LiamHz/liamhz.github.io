This is water, DFW's commencement speech is a great elucidation of how what you choose to worship is one of the most important choices you can make in life -- and how you respond to people's actions is up to you, while suggesting that you should almost always respond with compassion.

Akira's album lets you psyop yourself by listening to snippets from the speech accompanied by lofi repeatedly, letting the messages soak in
