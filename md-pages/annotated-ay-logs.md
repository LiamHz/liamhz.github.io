> Reading the "Early Life" section of Wikipedia pages for people I admire is chicken soup for the soul

I feel the same way whenever I read a biography of someone I admire. Reminds me that the important thing isn't to rush up the mountain, but to find the right mountain to climb, and then ascend with determination.

Tell JW where one can go dance in Waterloo

> Chances are, these people will always be in my life - I'll let the relationships form as they do, just by working on interesting stuff. I'd also rather put more effort into heads down researching more on housing/climate/policy, rather than being scattered. This feels like character development

Agreed! Even if the crystal ball said you should go, having the principle of defaulting to focus seems good. There's the bit in Hamming's "You and Your Research" about how working with a closed door is better for productivity, while open door is better for serendipity. I feel like both of us already receive more serendipity than we can handle, so trying to keep the door shut seems good.

I'm glad
