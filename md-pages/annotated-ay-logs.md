## 2022.10.01 to 2022.10.05
I really like these logs! They feel a lot more reflective than usual

Seems like you're really busy, hope you're finding time to breathe and touch every building in Waterloo

> There is a weird cultural dichotomy that splits people between makers and connectors... The distinction holds elements of truth, but ultimately feels unsatisfactory to me... That being said, I haven't been making enough time to be creative. This is especially true because personal relationships can feel pressing in a way that working on AfterEffects for 4 hours may not.

I think the last sentence here is the resolution to this "weird dichotomy". People can, and quite often are both, but what you identify with primarily is what you end up prioritizing.

Seems like you're somewhat aware of this and trying to shift from self-identifying as connector to maker which I'm glad to see -- will probably take a while for this to feel natural.

> I think a reason to stay more low profile is because I hate excluding people. If you don't advertise a hangout you can be more selective about who attends. This goes for Socratica and other life things.

Big agree. Weird thing is that most of the groups / communities we hear about are by definition the ones that are less exclusive -- so it's easy to unconsciously model our own social groups in this (lesser) mold

> I'd like to build more of a machine like we're done with UW Startups and Socratica where we don't really have to ask people to come to events... How do I do something similar for film?

I think short film club could be cool. Have people submit one short film / YT video, watch them together, and if people have something they've made or learnt they can give a little screening / presentation.

> I've been planning a pseudo-curriculum for myself re:film stuff...

I never quite figured out what areas you needed to grow in to make film / docu-journalism feel like a real career possibility were. It seems like you should be doing mini versions of projects that you would do on sabbatical _now_, but maybe you already are.

Film curriculum seems like a step in this direction. Hope you're able to follow through on it, or find someone to help you do so. Maybe start small (30 second film per week, quality doesn't matter) and ask JZ to hold you accountable?

## 2022.09.24
> Reading the "Early Life" section of Wikipedia pages for people I admire is chicken soup for the soul

I feel the same way whenever I read a biography of someone I admire. Reminds me that the important thing isn't to rush up the mountain, but to find the right mountain to climb, and then ascend with determination.

> Went dancing

Tell JW where one can go dance in Waterloo

> Chances are, these people will always be in my life - I'll let the relationships form as they do, just by working on interesting stuff. I'd also rather put more effort into heads down researching more on housing/climate/policy, rather than being scattered. This feels like character development

Agreed! Even if the crystal ball said you should go, having the principle of defaulting to focus seems good. There's the bit in Hamming's "You and Your Research" about how working with a closed door is better for productivity, while open door is better for serendipity. I feel like both of us already receive more serendipity than we can handle, so trying to keep the door shut seems good.

> I feel a sense of levity tonight. It's a combination of having some stressors relieved and dancing in the living room with JM

I'm glad
