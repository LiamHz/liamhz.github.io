        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>
          From 2016 to 2022 I worked in software engineering and AI.
          After realizing that I wanted to tell stories and create art instead of tools,
          I left my job to become an art student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? People in the western world live in material abundance, but are oftentimes spiritually impoverished.
          One reliable wav to give others the courage to radically improve their lives is to show them inspiring narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to spend my life creating films that give people the courage needed
          to ask out the cute girl they have a crush on and other similarly important life decisions.

              <blockquote>
                A book about all the ways a relationship can be broken and beautiful, and how a man tries to move on from heartbreak.
                <br/><br/>I read this after my first relationship ended after two years. Shortly after I had a few opportunities to have casual sex with people, but I passed on all of them, fearing that it'd feel empty without loving the other person. I don't want to treat people like a game that I solve for sex.
                <br/><br/>"I know that's what people say - you'll get over it. I'd say it, too. But I know it's not true. Oh, you'll be happy again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the person reminds you of them."

              <blockquote>
                A Little Life is a book about four friends: their lives, ambitions and trauma. It follows them over the course of several decades, exploring how beautiful, wretched, and wonderful life and its relationships are.
                <br/><br/>All of the characters felt incredibly real, and because of this it was the first book that made me cry. It's an example of the tupe of art that I want to spend my life creating.

              <blockquote>
                Phillip Glass worked day jobs for 21 years before being able to make a living off music.
                Despite this, composing was his driving goal and identity the whole time, and he never compromised on his creative vision by writing anything like ad jingles.

                <br/><br/>
                At some point I realized that I want to make my own films. This gave an immense amount of clarity, but also a huge mountain to climb: knowing that I'll have to learn how to wrtie fiction, and become proficient in the language of visual storytelling.

              <blockquote>
                Last year I had my heart broken. This film's final act is the first time I’ve felt anything like closure

                <br/><br/>
                There's one scene where the husband feels insecure with his wife hanging out with her childhood sweetheart.
                He says to her "You and him make such a good story. And in that story I'm the big bad white husband standing between you and destiny”.
                Almost breaking the fourth wall and saying that in a lesser film they'd devolve into fighting, or she'd end up with the guy.
                But instead the director (it's her first film, and based on her life) navigates this whole love triangle so delicately, and in such a real and mature way
