<h1>Head Anatomy 1, Week 2</h1>
<p>Week of June 13<br />
12h 22m of drawing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>one day you write a song<br />
the next day you write a poem<br />
and then the third day you do a drawing<br />
and none of it adds up to anything</p>
<p>all you're doing is laying a single brick of a million different
houses and expecting that one day it'll magically become a mansion</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The past year or so I've tried learning how to make music, play
guitar, do game dev, skateboard, and render with blender -- but I didn't
reach a significant level with proficiency with any of these because I
kept switching between all of them.</p>
<p>Drawing is the first thing in a while that I believe I'll stick with
and get really good at.</p>
<p>I improved a ton over the past week. I started using a blending stick
towards the end, and the increase in shading fidelity helped me define
forms a lot better.</p>
<h2>Monday</h2>
<div class="ahs-description">

<p>35m drawing<br />
Cooked dinner and hung out with friends, but I still manage to squeeze
in some time to work through the Proko tutorial on the anatomy of
lips.</p>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<div class="ahs-description">

<p>2h 25m<br />
Started on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A_kQsxeeTE">100
heads challenge</a></p>
<p>I've previously read the advice of <a
href="https://noahbradley.com/dont-go-to-art-school/">don't go to art
school</a> (tl;dr 4-year undergrad programs often focus on the
conceptual rather than craft side of art, and they're very expensive),
but right before I went to bed I started researching a 1-year concept
art school in Singapore called <a
href="https://fzdschool.com/">FZD</a></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time this week collecting as many reviews and leaked
course materials as I could. All students have to sign an NDA so it was
surprisingly hard to find info. I think there's a 50% chance I travel to
Asia for the first time in my life to attend FZD.</p>
<p>I posted some of my notes on FZD <a
href="https://gist.github.com/LiamHz/310516f30db73059c8f42ef1ba0e7427">here</a></p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<div class="ahs-description">

<p>1h 55m<br />
I like how having a fixed challenge, in this case drawing 100 heads from
a list of references, removes the possibility of procrastination through
decision making. It's clear that the only productive thing to do right
now is put pencil to paper.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>
<div class="ahs-description">

<p>1h 52m<br />
First time using a blending stick. I love how the two old men look.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>
<div class="ahs-description">

<p>2h 18m<br />
Really happy with the shading of the two on the left</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>
<div class="ahs-description">

<p>1h 15m<br />
Got stuck at a party that I didn't want to be at, so it was nice to be
able to draw in the corner.</p>
