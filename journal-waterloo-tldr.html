<h2>Friday, September 2</h2>
<p>Hung out with AY and JP downtown. I felt incredibly happy: being with
close friends in-person is so rare, and just existing together, not
being in a rush to do anything is nice. Wandered around downtown for a
bit, then worked and played chess at a library.</p>
<p>After an hour of talking, and me telling about leaving tech to study
art, I could see him reach a tipping point in trust internally, and he
opened up to me about how he's thinking of leaving his company to go
explore. His thought process mirrored my own.</p>
</div>
## Tuesday, September 6
Moved to Waterloo and walked around campus for a bit. It's nice to see so many kids with backpacks walking around

<p>Went rock climbing with JW (my roommate for the third month / city in
a row) and grabbed dinner at Osmow's</p>
<h2>Wednesday, September 7</h2>
<p>For the past ~4 months I've kept it a secret from AY that I was gonna
live in Waterloo from September through December, and convinced her that
I was gonna be living in NYC. There's been so many close calls the past
month where the surprise almost got ruined, but I was able to knock on
her door and surprise her tonight</p>
<p>Drew and worked next to a grand piano in one of the student
engineering buildings. Good vibes</p>
<h2>Thursday, September 15</h2>
<p>Started watching Cyberpunk Edgerunners, the first TV show I've
watched in many months.</p>
<p>I’m very close to the most influential people in tech, and feel like
I may be making a mistake by walking away</p>
<p>What would I use this influence for?</p>
<p>I don’t think engineering is suited for the type of things I want to
accomplish in life</p>
<p>Better production of goods won’t improve life satisfaction for people
in North America. Better stories can. The lack of compelling narratives
makes people feel less agency / self-narrative / courage</p>
<p>I want to create art, not tools<br />
I want to tell stories that move people</p>
<p>What stories have moved me?<br />
What do I want to say?</p>
<p>I want to inspire people to live their life to the fullest. Joy /
kindness / passion / determination / love / responsibility </p>
<p>I should do this for myself more, and find art / stories that inspire
me to do so</p>
<p>I should live, travel, talk, and read more<br />
I should be more playful and spark joy for others more often</p>
<p>I care about helping people solve personal problems and find
fulfillment. I want people to have all the deeply meaningful warm
fuzzies</p>
<p>I should sprint towards storytelling with art via animation / comics
this winter, rather than only doing it once my drawing fundamentals are
“ready”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing about drawing is that, if you put in serious effort, you
will become good at it. But that’s all the more reason to study a
variety of things that interest you while you have time, before you
enter the professional world in order to develop such fundamentals as
your own viewpoint and way of thinking.</p>
<p>If you don’t do this, your life will be treated as just another
disposable product... Should you ever relinquish what you truly hold
dear, the only path left to you will be that of a pencil-pusher—the type
of animator whose sense of self- worth is determined by the numerical
amount of his earnings, or who cycles between joy and despair over the
high or low ratings his work receives. -- Hayao Miyazaki</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Saturday, September 17</h2>
<p>I was wandering around the engineering building, looking for a place
where I could draw while enjoying hackathon vibes, when I walked by the
girl I spent countless hours with and had a crush on back in grade
11.</p>
<p>We spent the day together catching up, wandering, talking, and
climbing.</p>
<p>Was nice to be able to reconnect with somebody who important in my
past, while not feeling hung up or confused about anything. Was a good
day with an old friend, without the expectation of staying in touch
after.</p>
<p>Went rock climbing, and ran into somebody AY introduced me to at last
week's startup event. Spent an hour together climbing, lifting, and
talking. New friend :)</p>
<h2>Sunday, September 18</h2>
<p>AY called me in the morning to tell me that the past two days she's
been fighting with her bf. She was given the ultimatum of breaking up
with him, or never talking to me again. She chose the latter.</p>
<p>I've never felt more sad in my life than now.</p>
<p>I met AY 368 days ago, and since then she's been such a big part of
my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only person my age who I admire every aspect of</li>
<li>The person I came to with every thought and question that felt
important to me</li>
<li>The reason why I had the imagination and courage to leave tech to
pursue art</li>
<li>The thing that pushes me to improve and flourish in life has been
her</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope she lives a great life.</p>
<p>I wish I could be part of it.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, September 28</h2>
<p>Presented at Numerai OKRs this morning, RC yelled at me about
research details, but MP was very happy with it since my research is one
of the most impactful things this year. Good to have someone in your
corner.</p>
<p>After the presentation, I realized that I deal with my dad’s and RC’s
yelling in the same way, just tuning out emotions and responding from
the head only.</p>
<p>Spent the rest of the day doing art stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>Watched the first few lectures in a course on <a
href="https://creatureartteacher.com/product/storyboard-course-with-lyndon-ruddy/">storyboarding</a></li>
<li>Got a Sheridan animation student to tutor me once a week</li>
<li>Found a spreadsheet of <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-dMMZ6EYUTH8PRYAW4K-wzbaFRLPD94OXvyBKSpFo1E/edit#gid=0">Sheridan
2021 portfolios</a> with scores</li>
<li>Downloaded a dozen portfolios as PDFs, then wrote a bash script to
convert each page into a jpeg file</li>
<li>Made a <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12EU79i-86F15TP_JeSzqOD1sF4Eyamzm/view?usp=sharing">Figma
board</a> organizing the portfolio submissions by category and score. I
have a much better sense of what I need to learn, where I need to be by
February, and common mistakes people make</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing all of the student portfolios honestly has me feeling a bit
overwhelmed. There's so much I need to learn in the next 4 months to
have a chance of getting into Sheridan. It's also really exciting, even
if I don't get in I'll have gotten so much better at character design /
storyboarding / illustration / animation by shooting for this.</p>
<h2>Friday, September 30</h2>
<p>Got a second tutor for Sheridan animation (8-person study group, two
lectures a week + assignments). It's kinda crazy how much I've improved
at art while being entirely intrinsically motivated -- but know that
having friends with who inspire me and push me to achieve more is really
important.</p>
<p>AY was this.</p>
<p>Just gotta do what I can, to find something just like this (cue Chris
Martin).</p>
<p>Spent a few hours doing figure drawing assignments for the study
group.</p>
<p>Feeling the beginnings of stir craziness from living on my own and
not interacting with any friends this week. I should host a dinner party
for friends this weekend.</p>
<h2>Friday, October 7</h2>
<p>Spent the day doing original character designs for Kaz, and slowly
fell into a well of despair.</p>
<p>I drew over 40 designs, and only 5 of them look remotely good. I feel
so much worse than the other student’s in Kaz’s class</p>
<p>New Charlie Puth album came out -- I really like it despite (or maybe
because) every song makes me think of AY</p>
<p>Cooked dinner while singing along</p>
<h2>Wednesday, October 12</h2>
<p>The past week I've been productive for both Numerai and art, which
makes me happy -- but all the other things I enjoy about life (AY,
friends, exercise, new experiences) are missing</p>
<h2>Tuesday, October 18</h2>
<p>Losing AY has been hard</p>
<p>I've been depressed since then. Sometimes I'll have good evenings
because of art progress, but within 24 hours I'll be feeling rock bottom
again.</p>
<p>Coming to SF was supposed to be a great distraction from what
happened, but working two jobs ended up being stressful, and Paris
didn't happen which led to me being socially stranded in SF for 3
weeks</p>
<p>Depression and loneliness in SF has been really conducive to putting
in hours studying art. I know I'm distracting myself, but at least I'm
productive</p>
<p>I stopped updating logs and using Curius / Twitter / Instagram
because I don't want AY to be able to peer into my life.</p>
<p>I catch myself in negative thought spirals -- e.g. "how is it fair
that AY posed an ultimatum a month ago, JZ picked both -- and yet JZ's
ultimatum doesn't have both as an option".</p>
<p>I hate how literally every moment I have alone with myself I catch
myself in a thought spiral or disassociating to avoid the pain. I
haven't had wandering thoughts about anything else in weeks.</p>
<p>I catch myself flinching away from developing friendships because I'm
scared to experience echos of loss: cherishing somebody in my life, and
then them leaving me.</p>
<p>I don't have anybody that I can open up to and talk about all of this
with</p>
<p>I can't bring myself to listen to Noah Kahan's new album</p>
<p>That's a lot... what's been good lately?</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm excited to leave Numerai and start studying art full-time</li>
<li>Art progress since joining Kaz's study group two weeks ago has been
incredible</li>
<li>I'm glad that when I exit thought spirals my resentment towards AY
quickly fades. She's an amazing person, I'm glad she was part of my life
for the past year, and I can't wait to see what she does this year</li>
<li>I'm looking forward to being back in Waterloo, living with JW, and
being surrounded by friends. Life has been devoid of color lately, but
I'm hopeful that campus life will saturate things</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want to cry and eat ice cream with AY :/</p>
<h2>Wednesday, October 19</h2>
<p>Last day with coworkers at the office. Kinda crazy that I won't see
MP, RC, and others for at least a year. Bit sad that me and MP barely
spent time together this past month in SF, think things never went back
to normal after he almost fired me.</p>
<p>Went to trivia night at a bar with coworkers -- after a tragic one
point loss we placed 2nd.</p>
<h2>Monday, October 24</h2>
<p>Scheming</p>
<h2>Tuesday, October 25</h2>
<p>Showed up at the bus stop to surprise AY on her arrival back from SF.
Glad I could scheme one last time.</p>
<p>Drew a lot.</p>
<p>Realized that I should say the last goodbye to AY today.</p>
<p>We called for an hour.</p>
<p>Came to the conclusion that 6 months from now I'll message JZ and ask
him if me and AY can be friends again. AY seemed optimistic about this,
and I feel so much better because of it. Until then, the plan is to have
no contact with each other. This'll be hard, but infinitely better than
never being friends again.</p>
<p>Rambled on the phone because neither of us wanted to hang up.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, October 26</h2>
<p>Life drawing in person is so much fun!!! Tonight was my first time,
two dozen people seated around a small lit stage and a model -- also my
first time feeling like the act of creating art amongst others is a
little bit magical.</p>
<p>Mom emailed me with pictures of Gandalf, and told me about how she
held his paw while he was euthanized at the vet today. Cried myself to
sleep, life is hard right now :/</p>
<p>Some stuff from yesterday that I omitted</p>
<ul>
<li>While on call with AY I cried a lot. It was my first time properly
crying about this whole thing. Felt very cathartic</li>
<li>AY mentioned that I'm the only person who reads who logs, so she'll
be taking them down now. Was touching to realize that she wrote them for
me.</li>
<li>After calling AY, as soon as I got home my sister FaceTimed me
crying, and told me that Gandalf (our cat since I was 12 years old) is
dying -- this combined with AY leaving has me feeling the worst I've
felt in my life. Hopefully only up from here</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday, November 4</h2>
<p>Followed Kaz's art schedule, drew for 4 hours today, sent hourly
updates to our Discord server.</p>
<p>Good climbing session, flashed a bunch of oranges and came within
touching distance of my first pink</p>
<p>Called with NZ for an hour and a half. Caught up on life, talked a
bit about how we both really enjoyed our time together while we were
in-person, despite eventually breaking up. I'm glad I have good
relationships with all of my exes :)</p>
<p>I love esports, I love the Overwatch League -- I watched the grand
finals tonight which were hype. Was in a really good mood the whole time
while watching them watching them.</p>
<h2>Saturday, November 5</h2>
<p>During class Kaz mentioned that he showed my art schedule and hourly
updates to his other study group, and their reaction was "who the heck
is this guy!?"</p>
<p>Inspiring awe in a group of people is something I love, and that I
haven't done since leaving college to work at Numerai. Other times in my
life were TKS from "paper a day" onwards, and when I was the grind
rapidly improving at Go.</p>
<p>Feels so good to be a man on a mission again.</p>
<p>Watched League of Legend world finals with 50 people on TV monitors,
hosted by the Waterloo esports club. Had such a good time watching and
yelling with the crowd. I'll never forget when Guma stole Baron in Game
5, and we all erupted in incoherent yelling.</p>
<p>Right as the match ended, AL messaged me and we ended up going on a
40-minute walk. Conversation meandered towards what we look for in
romantic partners, fears and desires in life etc. I'm always really
happy when we spend time together.</p>
<h2>Sunday, November 6</h2>
<p>Updated my Hacklodge music video to be an art sabbatical announcement
video while at Socratica. Demo'd at the end, and people were speechless
afterwards. A lot of people came up to me and said they had chills while
watching -- feels good :)</p>
<p>Walked home with Kellie while happily babbling together.</p>
<h2>Monday, November 7</h2>
<p>Posted art sabbatical announcement music video on Twitter -- it's
been a while since I have a banger tweet, feels good.</p>
<p>Went to the arcade with EU. We talked and played arcade games
together for two hours.</p>
<p>Also, THEY HAVE DDR</p>
<h2>Tuesday, November 8</h2>
<p>Took the train to Toronto with EU. Drew her while she slept, and
played "we're not really strangers" when she work up.</p>
<p>Hung out and ate dinner with family and great grandma.</p>
<p>Hung out with TA in the evening. I think he's the closest friend I
have in my life now. We only talk once every few months, but I really
enjoy spending time with him, and I respect him and his thoughts.</p>
<p>We talked a bit about girls. I mentioned how I was interested in a
few, but was sad that I wouldn't be staying in Waterloo long enough to
have a relationship. He said "live life and embrace its temporary-ness!
I agree with him.</p>
<p>Called AL about the HN drama below, and asked if she wanted to go to
the arcade together on Friday. I'll make a move, and either sparks will
fly or I'll get rejected. Looking forward to it either way.</p>
<p>Right before going to bed, a mentor I hadn't talked to in 3 years
messaged me, congratulating me for having my blog post on Hacker News. I
have not written a blog post recently -- *panic*. Turns out that in the
morning Vincent bookmarked my draft and Curius, and a mutual
acquaintance then posted that to HN.</p>
<p>I quickly replaced the article with a V2 I had laying in drafts that
better captures my thoughts -- only 2000 people saw the original
version.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, November 9</h2>
<p>Woke up to 6000+ page views, 100+ comments, and a dozen DMs from kind
strangers</p>
<p>Drew for a few hours at the Wombo office, and replied to people's
messages. Also finished off the 2nd half of my blog post, focusing a bit
more on "why art" and less "why leave tech"</p>
<h2>Monday, November 28</h2>
<p>Chatted to Joss while she was planning Socratica's Symposium
presentations. She put me as the first presenter, and noted that it's
really nice to have somebody doing something artistic, and it's funny to
note how much working at Numerai for 2 years legitimizes my new pursuit
of art to people -- I'm not some rando doing art in their eyes, I'm "one
of them", highly accomplished, and doing something they think is cool
and different.</p>
<p>Went to the gym and lifted / chatted with my gym crush (Nicole) for
an hour. She's not "exceptional" (or I haven't found out how she is
yet), but she's cute. Talking with her comes naturally. Fun times :)</p>
<h2>Tuesday, November 29</h2>
<p>Last night I sent a slightly suggestive joke to my gym crush, and
woke up to this message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, I’m flattered, but I thought we were leaning more towards being
platonic?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Felt sad and couldn't focus for two hours, but afterwards was happy
to realize that I just see it as a funny story now. Being able to flirt
without over-worrying about consequences is nice.</p>
<p>Anson texted me (after not talking at all for a few weeks) out of the
blue asking if we could talk at a cafe. Turns out a friend of her's had
unexpectedly died last week, and she went to her funeral this morning.
Anson felt the same as I did after the dog died in my arms, an
overwhelming sense of wanting to be in each other's lives after being
reminded of mortality. It was nice to chat for two hours, but I don't
think anything between us will change in the near term</p>
<p>Today was exactly a year since the last "emotional pour" when I
visited her in Vancouver. Guess the last Tuesday of November is a
recurring tradition now.</p>
<p>Went to Indian dancing (Bhangra) again. The choreography this week
was easier than last week's, and the session was way more fun as a
result. Danced with Lagan as my partner, and chatted about art and life
afterwards while walking back home.</p>
<p>Kellie / Binal / Nicole (gym crush) / Lagan -- I'm happy to see that
I've gotten a lot better at chatting to girls this month. Think the main
realization is that I just have to initiate conversation, but what that
thing isn't doesn't matter all too much: just asking about one of their
interests or a random observation is enough to get the ball rolling.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, November 30</h2>
<p>Went to life drawing with Joss and Lagan. We all sat next to each
other while in the session, and once we were done we moved outside and
compared our drawings.</p>
<p>Went to the gym with Nicole. Afterwards we were walking and talking
about life, and when we got to the place where we go our separate ways
she asked "can we keep walking?" -- we walked through Laurier, I played
her piano, and when we completed our first lap, back to the splitting
point, we wordlessly continued on for our second lap.</p>
<p>We end up walking for an hour and a half. It's freezing cold the
whole time, and my hands are freezing because I'm carrying around my
skateboard.</p>
<p>It's my first time experiencing the playful flirting banter that I've
heard described so many times before. Our chemistry is off the charts,
but she has a boyfriend. I'm more than happy to just be friends
though.</p>
<p>What a wonderful night.</p>
<h2>Thursday, December 1</h2>
<p>Nicole wanted to go the gym on back to back days. Lifted, and then
walked for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>We were talking about how ghosting people you've gone on a date with
feels wrong, and I suggested that the same holds true with anyone you've
spent a few hours 1 on 1 with.</p>
<p>She asked if we were close enough, that if either of us disappeared
we should send an explanation to the other. Despite only knowing each
other for a few days, the 6 hours together the past two days made us
agree that we should.</p>
<p>Was a nice roundabout way of saying that we care about each
other.</p>
<h2>Friday, December 2</h2>
<p>Tonight was Socratica's symposium!</p>
<p>I finished drawing two hours before the event started to hang out
with Aadil and Jim, and at that point I started feeling incredibly
anxious. Joss put me as the first person to present -- I knew I was
gonna talk about why I left Numerai to study art, and show my <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wquO5Rc8Ldo">year of art
video</a>, but I guess I was nervous because it's been years since I've
presented in front of dozens of strangers.</p>
<p>I spent an hour writing a script, then another hour at the venue
rehearsing and revising it.</p>
<p>My presentation went amazing -- I think it was the best of the night
by a fair margin.</p>
<p>Seeing Anson allude to all the things she's done the past few months
in preparation for her film sabbatical made me both happy for her, but
also sad that I missed out on seeing her rise to the occasion here.</p>
<p>Talked to a bunch of people after the presentations were done</p>
<ul>
<li>"I read your blog posts the other day. If art doesn't work out as a
career, you should become a writer. Your 2022 recap gave me Murukami
vibes"</li>
<li>"You're one of those geniuses, aren't you?"</li>
<li>"Let's go climbing in Brooklyn next year"</li>
</ul>
<p>Went home and played Mario Kart and Pico Park while singing along to
Hamilton with Aadil and Jim.</p>
<h2>Thursday, December 8</h2>
<p>Drew at the library for the day, and then went to Jim's office for
the party. Talked to people a bit, danced in the front row while
watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t9TxR4IolM">Good
Kid</a> perform</p>
<p>Didn't want to sleep at my family's place (on the tiny mattress in my
sister's room) so I took the late-night bus back to Waterloo.</p>
<p>Read A Little Life for most of the journey home.</p>
<p>I finished part 3 of the book in bed, which ended with this quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the only trick of friendship, I think, is to find people who are
better than you are—not smarter, not cooler, but kinder, and more
generous, and more forgiving—and then to appreciate them for what they
can teach you, and to try to listen to them when they tell you something
about yourself, no matter how bad or good it might be, and to trust
them, which is the hardest thing of all. but the best, as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and sobbed for the first time in a month. I miss Anson</p>
<h2>Friday, December 9</h2>
<p>Lifted with Nicole, then walked for an hour. Talked about the book,
which characters we saw ourselves and each other in, and the things that
weigh on us the most right now (Anson for me, lack of ambition for
her)</p>
<p>I think we'll spend a lot of time together in Toronto until I leave
for Brooklyn. It's nice to have a new close friend.</p>
<h2>Saturday, December 10</h2>
<p>Drew for most of the day.</p>
<p>Got a portfolio review from Kaz for the first time in two weeks. I
got so much good feedback, took a bunch of notes, and then spent an hour
turning these notes into a todo list for the week.</p>
<p>I haven't felt great about my drawing productivity the past two
weeks, so this feels like a good nudge to shift into high gear
again.</p>
<h2>Sunday, December 11</h2>
<p>Met up with Nicole and her friends to go thrifting. Her friend was
driving us, and at a light that was red she kept accelerating until we
were partway through the intersection before slamming on the breaks. We
were all fine, but the driver was really shaken. After half an hour of
her shaking while others comforted her we decided to head back home.</p>
<p>Watched The Hangover, I drew some hands while enjoying the other's
enjoying this movie for the first time.</p>
<p>Me and Nicole went to the gym, started our usual post-workout walk,
and then ended up back at her place to watch "Before Sunrise" -- I had
mentioned it as my favorite film after EEAAO to her last week.</p>
<p>The film is about two people who meet on a train, and decide to spend
the night walking through Vienna before one of them has to fly back
home.</p>
<p>The film doesn't have a strong plot or any conflicts, and is instead
focused on the conversations between the two. We paused the movie a
bunch of times to talk, and share our takes on the ideas they were
sharing.</p>
<p>At some point she asked me how many times I've been in love. When I
said twice, she correctly guessed Brianna and Anson. Mention of the
latter led the topic of emotional cheating to come up, and she mentioned
that she didn't really see that as a thing -- that only physical
intimacy was seen as cheating in her eyes.</p>
<p>I think this is what she believes (and me as well as long as you're
honest with your partner), but I think it was also her way of
acknowledging how close we are, saying that she's comfortable with it,
while still setting a line in the sand.</p>
<p>At the end of the film, the two characters separate, and it's
ambiguous whether they'll ever see each other again.</p>
<p>Despite us only knowing each other for two weeks we had both thought
of me leaving for Brooklyn in February, and if we'd still be friends
after. If I get into Sheridan I'll come visit her.</p>
<h2>Monday, December 12</h2>
<p>First day working through the big art todo list for the week I made
after Kaz's portfolio feedback. Spent most of the day drawing hands and
animation key frames on campus.</p>
<p>Decided that I'd block Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter for the week.
Partly because I want to reclaim my attention span, but also because I
don't want to read about AI art every single fucking day.</p>
<p>Today was also Anson's birthday. I wrote her a letter, and dropped it
off along with a copy of A Little Life outside her door. Managed to not
think about her through the day, but at night I wasn't able to fall
asleep and started feeling sad about the past.</p>
<p>The next morning I woke up to a text from her, sent at 2am, saying
"thank you for the book -- I'm 150 pages in and annotating"</p>
<p>Thank you for reading Joss :)</p>
