<p>
Broke up with Nancy two days ago. Despite not finding a life partner I still wouldn't have done anything differently. Committing to a relationship quickly when I feel a spark is what I'll continue doing in the future -- even if things go south it's alright since I'm honest throughout and feel fine breaking things off when I know it won't work out.

<p>
Numerai rented a sailboat to watch the Independence day fireworks. Out on the Bay the fireworks were so close that they filled my entire field of view.

<h2>Tuesday, July 5</h2>
<p>
I'm happy keeping the number of people I'm close to small, since no matter how busy life is I can always be there for them

<p>
Really enjoying DDR. Am consistently beating the hardest songs on "Hard". Gonna try and beat a song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild") this week, which is crazy since this was on my short list of goals in life last month.

<p>
Managed to fit in 2.5 hours of drawing boxes during 5 hours of work meetings.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Thursday, July 7</h2>
<p>
Every other Thursday Numerai has a massage therapist come into the office and give everyone the most wonderful 30 minute massage.

<p>
Today she commented on how the shape of my back and its muscles have changed over the past month from me rock climbing.

<p>
It's strange to have someone know your body better than your mind.

<h2>Friday, July 8</h2>
<p>
Played DDR for an hour and came within inches of beating a song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild")

<p>
This past week I've spent 13 hours drawing 130 boxes in an attempt to improve my skill at perspective. Normally I draw at home with music on, but tonight I listened to a video suggesting that only doing drawing studies isn't the best -- a large amount of drawing what you love is great to try out different styles, apply what you've learnt in studies, and nurture your soul.

<p>
I'm gonna carve out an hour every morning to draw for fun.

<h2>Saturday, July 9</h2>
<p>
In Vegas for RC's birthday party
<ul>
<li>Private jet with live saxophone
  <li>Front row seats at Cirque du Soleil (Michael Jackson One)
  <li>Party at the penthouse of Westgate, the suite where Elvis used to live
  <li>Afterparty at RT's house, interior design was what every kid dreams of
</ul>

<p>
There was a dozen times tonight where in the middle of talking to someone they'd do a line of coke.

<p>
Iâ€™m on the peak of a mountain that I do not want to be on

<p>
I do not want to be around these people, talk about money, or do drugs

<p>
Met EC, got the sense she was dissatisfied with her finance job. She's like me at a similar stage in life, but more advanced in every way (salary, art skill, education level etc)

<p>
I want to live a life and be around people where I can be completely honest with what I'm thinking about and who I am.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Sunday, July 10</h2>
<p>
Woke up in the Elvis suite, swam in the pool for a bit, played piano while private jet guy played saxophone, and ate breakfast served by the suite's butler.

<p>
Talked with CL while eating tacos for lunch. Was nice to hear that the casual drug usage on display at all of the Numerai parties I've been to is much more extreme than anything else he's seen while working

<p>
Drew a scene of Venice -- was my first time drawing for fun instead of a study. I enjoyed it, and decided to buy an iPad pro. Am excited to be able to draw in high fidelity with vibrant colors in any cafe.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>
RC's birthday in Vegas

<p>
Drew 130 boxes over 13 hours

<p>
Realized that I'm at the peak of a life that I do not want to live

<p>
Numerai company onsite this week! Half of our team is remote -- it's nice to have everyone together.
<p>
Went to our COO's house and went on a hike, had a pool party, and ate lunch from a taco truck guy.

<p>
It was a nice day, but also good to remember that working away at a hedge fund to afford all this isn't my goal in life.

<p>
Felt guilty about having fun with coworkers, knowing that I'll soon leave and break everyone's hearts.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Tuesday, June 28</h2>
<p>
AY's response to me feeling guilty about leaving was "I think they'd want you to leave and follow your dreams". It's a nice sentiment, but I think the subtext here is "don't you dare wuss out of this"  

<p>
This subtext was a nice push to finally email my landlord and request to terminate my lease and move out on Aug 5, the day I fly out for NYC.  

<p>
Things are in motion that cannot be undone.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Wednesday, June 29</h2>
<p>
AY recently redesigned their website, which inspired me to revamp mine as well.

<p>
Chia and 100R's personal websites have been my favorite for a long time. I've borrowed their multi-column layouts and more prolific vibe for this new site.

<p>
Screenshots of my previous and redesigned website

<p>
MP told me what him and RC felt that they were missing in life, and asked what I feel I'm lacking in. I wonder if he has a hunch that I'm leaving
</p>

<h2>Thursday, June 30</h2>
<p>
Got to catch up with DH for the first time in months at the Numerai office party

<ul>
<li>Midjourney and the future of illustrators and concept artists
<li>Me leaving Numerai because I'm young and want to explore more of life. Was nice to have a mentor say that my plan "makes sense"
<li>Him encouraging me to go to Japan / Berlin instead of holing up in Canada
</ul>

<h2>Friday, July 1</h2>
<p>
Went to In n Out with JP, talked about how he's feeling burnt as a solo founder, and my essay on why I'm doing art.

<p>
I often say "I'm doing art because I like it". There's a lot more nuance to my thoughts, and my joke response is probably indicative of some insecurity

<p>
He likes the crackhead energy of dropping everything to pursue what feels right.

<p>
"I probably won't make much money as an artists" -- he doesn't believe this to be true as long as I apply a bit of tech thinking: high agency and aiming for the heavy tail
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Saturday, July 2</h2>
<p>
Coworked via Discord with Alex Honeycutt, the creator of the self study art curriculum I've been following the past two months.

<p>
Last week DR mentioned that he considered his attempt to self-study math the past year a failure, because there were often months where he felt intellectually isolated and didn't get anything done as a result.

<p>
It was nice talking to and co-existing with another person who left tech to pursue art. I'm gonna continue putting effort into making art friends and contributing to little corners of the internet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Sunday, July 3</h2>
<p>
Today was my ideal day: drawing, cooking, skateboarding, talking with AY, and DDR.

<p>
Thinking about how I haven't really watched any TV shows / movies, played many games, or read much fiction the past few months -- usually in pursit of being productive in my free-time.

<p>
Letting more quality long-form art and entertainment into my life is important for inspiration. Am most interested in media with unique art styles, interaction mechanisms that enhance immersion, and worlds / characters with depth.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned my website
<li>Terminated my lease
<li><a href="/art-home-school/perspective-1-week-1.html">Completed perspective 1 week 1</a>
<li>Played a lot of DDR
<li>Learned how to ollie
</ul>

<p>
I feel much more emotionally well and stable than I did last year
