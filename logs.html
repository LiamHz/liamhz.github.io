<h1>August Week 2</h1>
<h2>Sunday, August 14</h2>
<p>Had to do Numerai work for 5 hours to wrap up things before starting
my two weeks of vacation, since I didn't work much on Thursday and
Friday because of Interact's symposium</p>
<p>Went bouldering with JW, then headed to Interact's after-after
party</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately most of my friends had already left NYC</li>
<li>Ate shake shack under the brooklyn bridge</li>
<li>Played ping pong while tipsy with JW</li>
<li>Corey lived on this <a
href="http://bethelfarm.org/spiritual-bb/">farm</a> during Covid, and
suggested that I do the same for two months during my art sabbatical
next year</li>
</ul>
<h2>Saturday, August 13</h2>
<p>Day 3 of Interact's symposium was filled with people in the residency
program presenting their work from the past 2 months</p>
<p><em>Mammoths and the Post-Anthropocene with Wendi Yan</em><br />
Seeing Wendi present on her film (read logs from prev. day for context)
was a joy. She showed an 8 minute short film which was fun to be
entranced by, despite her saying that none of this footage would end up
in the final cut.</p>
<p><em>Technological Literacy with Anna-Sofia</em><br />
One panelist was the former managing editor at TechCrunch. He mentioned
that the number of clicks your media gets isn't a good measure of
audience, since most of those people don't actually give a shit beyond
momentary entertainment. Preaching to the choir isn't that appealing, so
audience is the small amount of people you can convince to deeply
care.</p>
<p><em>The Neighborhood New York City with Priya</em><br />
A strong case for East Williamsburg, near Lorimer station, being the
best neighborhood in NYC was made: it's on the L line, near Vital
climbing, and has several coliving houses nearby. Also learned that NYC
local governance is surprisingly easy: you only need ~1000 signatures to
turn an area into a "slow street", and it's easy to get free materials
from city agencies (e.g. planting trees and providing trash bins)</p>
<p><em>RFID Tags and New Computing with Omar Rizwan</em></p>
<p><em>Structuring Digital Information Flows with Saffron
Huang</em><br />
I was only in the person in the audience of two dozen who did the
pre-readings of a 15 page research paper and Saffron's substack post on
privacy, so I came prepared with questions! Asked her how she thinks
we'll ever get to a world where large consumer companies respect
privacy, since they have no incentive to adopt privacy preserving
technologies.</p>
<p>After a bit of thought she responded that new technology enables new
regulations. E.g. for certain risky areas, government can demand audit
of algorithms via ZK in a way that preserves IP.</p>
<p>It's also not necessarily the case that privacy is a tradeoff between
utility and morals, since privacy tech enables new forms of expression.
E.g. being able to discuss online and show credentials such as your
research h-index without revealing your identity</p>
<p>Talked with Saffron for a bit afterwards about what she thinks she'll
end up doing in privacy. There's a spectrum between building
applications, doing research, and advocating for regulatory changes --
she leans towards doing research with organizations like <a
href="https://www.openmined.org">OpenMined</a></p>
<p><em>In the evening...</em><br />
Got dinner with TB and met Linus Lee for the first time. At one point I
asked what Linus has been up to lately, and TB asked "wait, do you not
know who he is". I said yeah, but didn't want to be the lame fan person
who says "omg I love Oak, how are you so prolific"</p>
<p>Played Chess with Interact people. Said hi to the person next to me,
we exchanged names and for a hot second we were perplexed, since we
recognized each other, but weren't sure from where. Eventually I
mentioned that I was going on art sabbatical, she exclaimed that she was
too, then we realized I had DMd her about her thread on sabbaticals a
month ago</p>
<p>Talked with Weiwei for two hours about sabbaticals, being lost while
exploring life, and her work at Dynamic Land &amp; current startup</p>
<p><em>Parting thought</em><br />
On the way to the symposium in the morning I had the realization that
nearly every conversation I have goes incredibly well, yet I still have
a fear of talking to new people. I'm happy with how I pushed myself to
talk to more new people today, but need to keep this in mind for the
future as well.</p>
<h2>Friday, August 12</h2>
<p>Day 2 of Interact's symposium was filled with panels<br />
I took lots of notes, but will just include the one thing that stuck
with me the most from each</p>
<p><em>What education could be with Matthew Jordan</em><br />
Education as a means (to get a job) vs as an end (for the love of the
craft). People who end up defining new paradigms are the latter, and
this usually includes them learning the history of their craft, so they
can build upon it.</p>
<p><em>State of venture capital with Kevin Kwok</em><br />
YC is just business school that's palettable to engineers.<br />
The real VC is the friends we made along the way, since everyone went
into VC</p>
<p><em>Models for co-living with Jason Benn and Devon Zuegel</em><br />
Jason Benn started the best group house, The Archive, and is now working
on <a href="http://neighborhoodsf.com">The Neighborhood SF</a> which one
of my favorite projects in the world. I've followed him for a while, but
hearing him speak in person has made me a believer: scenius will form
around him.</p>
<p><em>Why are we so wimpy with Molly Mielke</em><br />
One panelist was asked "when was the time you felt most courageous" and
they responded that it was when they decided to go back to university in
Ireland and enjoy life instead of following their peer group to become a
founder in SF and raise millions of dollars.</p>
<p>I spoke to him afterwards, and told him that I felt similar, and was
making a similar decision w/r/t leaving AI to pursue art. He said that
my blog post on the shallowness of SF parties matched his experience, I
said "wtf, how did you find that". Turns out he saw me drawing
yesterday, thought that was interesting, and looked up my name / website
via the Symposium's group chat. New friend! He's the first person I've
met in person who's also read Infinite Jest.</p>
<p>In the evening, walked to shake shack with Marley, Santi, Brunella,
and Priya -- the last of whom is following in Jason Benn's footsteps and
organinzing The Neighborhood for NYC.</p>
<h2>Thursday, August 11</h2>
<p>Interact is hosting a symposium from today through Saturday, and
thanks to AY I got an invite.</p>
<p>Skateboarded through Brooklyn for the first time, and after arriving
I drew for two hours.</p>
<p>Attended the circle on "empact", a discussion on how to turn emotions
you feel from impactful media into real world action. They showed a
short animated film on the grief of parents who live on after their
child dies in a school shooting.</p>
<p>The discussion started off pretty dull, so I talked about</p>
<ul>
<li>My recent experience with the death of a dog</li>
<li>How I feel silly about only being able to think about my own little
problem rather than the larger national issue</li>
<li>How you have to choose to not be jaded to be moved by art</li>
</ul>
<p>After the session ended, I ended up going on a 20 minute walk with
one of the two organizers and got to hear about their frustration on
their inability to get people to act. In all of the sessions she's run
like this, everybody says how much they're affected by the film and how
they wish they could do more, but almost nobody clicks on the QR code /
links she provides at the end.</p>
<p>The disconnect that many have between pretending to care about topics
to appear pro-social and actually caring when on one's own bothers
me.</p>
<p>In the evening, went wandering the neighborhood with Brunella (new
friend!) for an hour, shared life stories, and then found ourselves in
the basement of the Interact residency house where <a
href="https://wendiyan.com">Wendi Yan</a> was presenting early work on
her in progress sci-fi documentary.</p>
<p>It was such a unique experience</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark basement, lit by flashlights that dangled from the ceiling</li>
<li>Disjointed footage of the arctic and Unreal Engine motion
graphics</li>
<li>Haunting singing in a foreign language with heavy reverb</li>
<li>A table of artifacts, sci-fi world building documents, books that
inspired her work, and the work journal she's used the past 3
months</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday, August 10</h2>
<p>Coworked at Verci with JW and TA, and then sat in on the first live
session for <a
href="https://community.lovelifedrawing.com/the-life-drawing-study-group">Kenzo's
life drawing study group</a>. I really like his way of teaching, and
will probably stick with this study group until the end of the year.</p>
<p>In the evening we walked for two hours walking through Washington
square park, Noho, and Soho for two hours. Eventually made our way down
to the arcade at Chinatown Fair and played DDR for a bit.</p>
<p>When visiting new cities some people like sampling restaurants, and
others tour museums. Mine will be dancing at arcades.</p>
<p>Went to a Jazz bar and caught up with TB -- my drawing progress and
his experience with synthesis school.</p>
<h2>Tuesday, August 9</h2>
<p>Worked from home. Went to a cafe's chess club, and met up with the
PUA person I met on the same night as AY. His dating startup failed, and
he's now a dating coach for middle aged men, going out with them to bars
and making $150/hour. A fun reminder of how different the lives of I've
interacted with can be.</p>
<p>Played chess for a few hours with Bushwick hipsters, then went to a
PC cafe.</p>
<h2>Monday, August 8</h2>
<p>Went to the NYC main library's Rose room to work, and as soon as I
walked in I had flashbacks to the last fall when I was here and all the
fun I had with AY and JJ.</p>
<p>Wandered up 5th avenue with JW, and bought some shorts at Uniqlo
because I was unprepared for the East coast heat wave.</p>
<p>Cooked spaghetti for the house while TA played Smash. Every now and
then I'd glance over to see how he was doing, and for the first time
viscerally understood the "are ya winning son" meme</p>
<h1>August Week 1</h1>
<h2>Sunday, August 7</h2>
<p>Walked through Bushwick for the first time with TA while doing
laundry and buying groceries. I really really like it here, so much more
than SF. Streets are busy and grungy in that perfect way in which they
feel lived in by people from all types of backgrounds.</p>
<p>Had the song <a href="https://youtu.be/xsQHuiLTgp4">I Think I'm Gonna
like it Here</a>, from the 2014 version of Annie, playing in the back of
my head while walking the streets despite not having this film for
years.</p>
<p>Went bouldering at MetroRock Bushwick with TA and JW. Glad to see
that I'm still a V3 climber on the east coast.</p>
<h2>Saturday, August 6</h2>
<p>Caught up on sleep. TA arrived at the Airbnb, then we went downtown
for a concert</p>
<p>Seeing Polyphia live was so good. Tim Henson is fun to watch in
person, and the songs (and probably metal music in general) get me and
the crowd so amped up.</p>
<p>Walking back home at midnight we saw so many hot young people out and
at bars. Streets being vibrant at night is something I didn't realize
how much I was missing while in SF until now.</p>
<h2>Friday, August 6</h2>
<p>Ever since living in New Mexico, whenever I leave a place I called
home, I listen to <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4yrjPmonSHiJIHum5TrqEe?si=bevvX9QBTNyiidC9tCqMxw">The
Making of a Paracosm by Kasbo</a> on the plane. The euphoric synths and
vocals in the first 4 songs of the album capture the melancholy I feel
when closing a chapter of life.</p>
<p>While on the plane I found my mind drifting to my exes: BG and NZ.
They were defining parts of the person I was the past two years in SF
while working at Numerai. Defining parts of this life I'm leaving
behind.</p>
<p>Landed in NYC at midnight.</p>
<h2>Thursday, August 5</h2>
<p>Said goodbye to all my coworkers who come to the office in-person,
and to our massage therapist.</p>
<p>Got dinner with MP, Jonathan, and Ben (coworkers) at Burma Superstar,
then went to a bar and talked for a few hours. I got kicked out of the
bar for being under aged, so I ended up leaning against the railing
while the lads drank at a table on the patio. At one point I grabbed my
glass of water to drink, the bartender saw and ran out to tell me to
stop, and I chugged the glass while staring him in the eyes.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, August 4</h2>
<p>Finished packing and completely emptied out my apartment</p>
<p>Watched Ghost in the Shell (1995) at the Cohere office with JW</p>
<p>I love how it was a slow film that threw you into the middle of
everything</p>
<p>Largely vibe driven, with a plot that you have to slowly piece
together</p>
<p>The three interlude scenes, where there was no dialogue and only
music with shots of the city felt magical</p>
<p><img src="img/gits-bedroom.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Tuesday, August 3</h2>
<p>Completed a significant refactor of the Numerai tournament website
that I started yesterday -- all the engineers were surprised and happy
with it when I presented the changes</p>
<p>Played League of Legends at f.inc with JW, AA, JP, and SA for a few
hours.</p>
<p>Slept over at the Cohere office</p>
<h2>Monday, August 2</h2>
<p>Posted this on Twitter</p>
<p><img src="../img/texture-sausage-tweet.png" /></p>
<p>Jay responded with this</p>
<p><img src="../img/jay-anime-training-tweet.png" /></p>
<p>Leaving everything behind to live a different life is exciting, I'm
optimistic about this next arc of my anime.</p>
<p>Drew intersecting boxes for the first time. There was a solid 20
minutes where I couldn't figure out how to do it properly (the tutorial
wasn't very helpful) and almost called it a night, so when it clicked it
felt euphoric.</p>
<p><img src="../img/intersecting-boxes.jpeg" /></p>
<h1>July, Week 3</h1>
<h2>Sunday, July 31</h2>
<p>Went on a 2 hour walk with a girl that I hung out with for a month,
then stopped talking to back in May. We caught up on life, her recent
trauma, my sabbatical plans, and sketched out plans to backpack Europe
or Thailand if I'm up for it next January or July.</p>
<p>At the end we played DDR for an hour.</p>
<p>It was really nice to catch up, and have some closure with the last
person I wanted to say goodbye to in SF.</p>
<p>Got a response from BG, my first ex, on the email I sent her a few
days ago -- it's our second email exchange since breaking up (the first
being on her birthday last month) and haven't talked outside of these
letters. I've realized that I'd like her to be part of my life, even if
it's just as friends so I'll keep sending her letters every 2 to 4
weeks.</p>
<p>Sold my mattress.</p>
<p>Went to f.inc and played League of Legends with JW and AA for a few
hours. It was my 3rd time playing and was so much fun. But it also
reminded of my fear of being a CS student at Waterloo addicted to
gaming.</p>
<p>I'm happy to play in person with friends whenever the opportunity
arises, and I'll just resist the urge to watch videos and git good.</p>
<p>At midnight, while the moon was obscured by clouds, JW and AA helped
me hack apart my sleeper sofa and illegally dump it outside.</p>
<p>Slept over at the Numerai office</p>
<h2>Saturday, July 30</h2>
<p>Drew in the morning, went climbing with JW and AA, then drew some
more.</p>
<p>I’m feeling a lot better than I have the past few days. Hoping that
I’m out of the post-death funk.</p>
<h2>Friday, July 29</h2>
<p>After I told CTO yesterday that I'd be leaving, he said that I was
one of the smartest people he's worked with, and appreciated my outlook
on life over the past two years. This was really nice, but I wasn't sure
how much of it was hollow flattery. Today he asked me to let him invest
$30k whenever I start a company. It's nice to have others believe in
me.</p>
<p>My ex posted a life update on Substack, and wrote a few blurbs about
how our relationship didn't work out, and how she thinks it's due to
previous emotional trauma that she's been trying to work out since then.
I messaged her to see if she wanted to call and catch up on life since
we parted ways, and sent a similar message to the girl I went to a few
concerts with the month before meeting my ex. Feels like I'm slowly
saying goodbye to SF and the people who defined it for me.</p>
<p>The past few days I've been unmotivated to do much in the evenings,
I'm accepting this as a temporary lull. Dog's owner sent out an obituary
email, and thanked me and Angela for helping. Cried a bit, then drew for
the first time since the potluck.</p>
<h2>Thursday, July 28</h2>
<p>Still don't feel great, but a bit better than yesterday.</p>
<p>Told RC and CTO that I'd be leaving Numerai in October. They were
both sad, but overall took it really well. RC appreciated me giving him
such a large heads up, and we did a bit of an exit interview. RC also
asked some good questions about if I thought I'd become complacent as a
middling artist and not end up with much a legacy — in the long-term, I
don't think so.</p>
<p>I'm happy focusing on improving my skill at art for the next year or
so, but I know the itch to make a name for myself will come back sooner
or later. This is also why I'm not too concerned about making money, I
know that I'll end up working at some point, and whatever it is I do
I'll do it very very well.</p>
<p>Finished reading Tigana</p>
<h2>Wednesday, July 27</h2>
<p>Sometimes when I'm on public transit my brain will zone out, and I
won't be present.</p>
<p>I wasn't present at any point today.</p>
<p>I feel so hollow and disconnected. Every time I became aware of my
surroundings again I'd think of the dog, slowly dying in my arms, and
I'd flinch away from that thought and immediately go back to zoning
out.</p>
<p>After failing to get work done for a few hours, I wrote a letter and
skateboarded down to drop it off with flowers. When I saw the owner, I
just started crying. I couldn't find any words to say, so we just hugged
for a bit.</p>
<p>Went to the gym, and right after I got back Kipply asked if I wanted
to play DDR with her at Ghirardelli. It was a nice distraction.</p>
<h2>Tuesday, July 26</h2>
<p>Took the day off from work and drew at the Cohere office, and later
on WeWork with JW, JP, and SA</p>
<p>Went to a potluck at TR's, arrived early to cook spicy cashew tofu
and caught up with him about</p>
<ul>
<li>Me leaving tech to do art</li>
<li>His feelings on how the engineer mindset is to mindlessly execute,
with minimal creative self expression — and how the nature of game dev /
film studios necessitates the opposite</li>
<li>Synthesis school grievances, seems like he'll also go on sabbatical
soon</li>
</ul>
<p>Ended up making a new friend, Angela Fan, talked about our
experiences in…</p>
<ul>
<li>finance and how it made us realize we don't care much for money</li>
<li>software dev (me) and product design (her), and how we grew to feel
that this isn't what we wanted our legacy to be</li>
</ul>
<p>Also asked her if any of her artist friends managed to make ends meet
while doing what they love. Her artist sphere is more experimental than
commercial (few concept / studio artists). Most of them are struggling
financially, but a few have landed residences or built a lucrative
following.</p>
<p>One thing that stuck with me is that the good life for an artist is
just being able to do their job while being financially stable. This is
in stark contrast to engineers where having a job is assumed. Making art
leads to a more frugal life, but I think also indicates that it's more
rewarding.</p>
<p>At the dinner party, me and the dog would run down the stairs every
time the doorbell rang to let in people. After a few hours, most people
had gone upstairs to talk, while me, Angela, and two other stayed
downstairs.</p>
<p>I was petting the dog, and became a bit concerned since it seemed so
lethargic. Angela started petting the dog and also was wondering if it
had a stomach ache. After a few more minutes I decided to get the owner.
He called the vet, while the dog's breathing got weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>I kept petting and petting, while breathing with the dog because I
was terrified that he'd stop at any moment. Eventually the dog pooped
itself while still on the ground, and shortly after we carried it
downstairs. When we got him into the car, his breathing was very weak,
and shortly after he started gasping and spasming.</p>
<p>The owner drove his dog to the vet, and the rest of us stayed behind
to clean up for a bit.</p>
<p>Angela drove me home, and while en route I got a call that the dog
died.</p>
<h2>Monday, July 25</h2>
<p>RC reemerged after a week of no-contact to announce that he's moved
to NYC. Feel bad that both me and him have left MP -- I hope he does
alright.</p>
<p>I had taken the day off work today, but ended up getting roped into 4
hours of work anyways. Not ideal, but freedom is only a few months
away.</p>
<p>Watched American Psycho with JW, some thoughts: The richness of your
interior life doesn't matter much if none of that is reflected in your
actions or how you treat others</p>
<p>Jung's concept of the shadow. Most of what I dislike about others is
because I fear or dislike some part of that in myself. I see my shadows
in others w/r/t stagnation, not following through on personal goals, not
being interesting to others, and not having anything to say that carries
meaning.</p>
<p>It's easier to love others as they are when I'm aware of why I
instinctively judge them.</p>
<h1>July, Week 2</h1>
<h2>Sunday, July 23</h2>
<p>AY and JM flew in from Arizona, and me and JW threw together a SF
adventure for them</p>
<ul>
<li>Dinner at New Thai Elephant</li>
<li>Biked to the Palace of Fine Arts, witnessed an ethereal
violinist</li>
<li>Biked to a fog obscured Golden Gate Bridge, overcast and spooky
stranger things vibes</li>
<li>Biked back home</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole adventure was so much fun, and I want to create a lot more
memorable experiences for the people I care about over the next few
months.</p>
<p>Am sad that JZ sat in the car reading instead of joining us. Feels
like he doesn't want to mend things between us, and that this won't ever
change.</p>
<p>Also a bit sad at not getting an invite from AY for group hiking at
Big Sur or roadtripping to LA. It's probably for JZ's sake and capacity
reasons.</p>
<p>But shared time is rare, life is short, and I've been putting in a
lot of effort to spend more time together in person. Not having this
reciprocated stings.</p>
<p>All that being said, I'm grateful for the past 9 months together and
all the ways I've grown because of that. Those months matters more to me
than the past week or two. Life gets busy, close friends make mistakes,
and yet I will happily choose to love them regardless over and over
again.</p>
<h2>Saturday, July 23</h2>
<p>Went to Marufuku ramen and then watched Nope with JW, MP, and BB</p>
<h2>Friday, July 22</h2>
<p>I finally told MP that I'll be leaving Numerai in October. After a
short pause, his first response was "I'm happy for you" -- there was a
bit of silence after since we didn't know what else to say, but after a
minute or two we started making jokes about it while lifting at the
gym.</p>
<p>He mentioned that he'd feel a bit bad if I was leaving to join
another tech company or hedge fund, but seems quite happy for me that
I'm going on sabbatical to explore art and other things.</p>
<p>Having the coworker I'm closest to know that I'm leaving, and him
being okay with it, makes it feel like a weight's been lifted.</p>
<h2>Thursday, July 21</h2>
<p>Yesterday me and MP launched a big revamp to Numerai's internal
universe. A lot of stuff broke this morning, and most of today was
bringing everything back to life.</p>
<p>Went rock climbing with MP and JW</p>
<p>Played guitar for the first time in months. I sold my piano a few
weeks ago, and am now feeling the itch to play some music again --
hoping that I'll end up getting good at guitar over the next few months,
but we'll see where life takes me.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, July 20</h2>
<p>I really respect Magnus Carlsen giving up the world chess champion
title today, it's hard to do what you know is best if there's large
social pressure to stay stagnant</p>
<h2>Tuesday, July 19</h2>
<p>Went to the Cohere SF office with JW. Got a bit of work done, then
drew for an hour. I'm able to draw heads just as well on iPad as paper
now</p>
<p>The reference I drew from today was actually one I drew 3 weeks ago.
In the pencil/paper sketch I didn't want to shade the left half b/c I
was worried I'd mess up the sketch. Comparing the two is a nice example
of how I'm more willing to shade more boldly on the iPad since erasing
is so much easier digitally</p>

</div>

<p>Went to a TKS dinner party. To a former TKS director: "I'm leaving
tech for a bit to go study art" -- "Cool! Like Paul Graham"</p>
<p>I want to become the Hayao Miyazaki of video games. A medium and
genre defining prolific creator.</p>
<p>This is what I want my art practice to eventually lead to, but I'm in
no rush to get there. </p>
<p>The plan is to still study art, but I definitely want to play some
games published by Annapurna Interactive (the A24 of video games),
experimental interactive fiction with unique art styles and mechanics,
and participate in a game jam every other month or so</p>
<h2>Monday, July 18</h2>
<p>I do leg day once a quarter<br />
Today was leg day with JW<br />
Pain</p>
<p>Sold my OP-1 to a guy off Facebook marketplace for $800 in cash. Was
stressful having a sketchy guy had me a wad of $100 bills, but we
survived</p>
<h1>July, Week 2</h1>
<h2>Sunday, July 17</h2>
<p>Drew for 90 minutes in Delores park with JW. Getting back up to speed
with drawing heads on the iPad</p>
<p>Met up with two of JW's friends from last night's party. One of the
two was "the hot girl" from the party -- I have a thing for skinny asian
girls with Calvin Klein bras now -- but when she talked while sober I
went "oh noes". It's weird how many people who seem great at a remove
aren't that interesting or personable when you get to know them.</p>
<p>Went to an art book fair. I really enjoyed
<a href="https://paragon-books.com/products/sketchbook-6">Felicia
Chao's</a> work, but apart from that I was surprised that most of the
book vendors didn't have a high degree of skill</p>
<p>Went rock climbing, then ate at Mensho's, my favorite ramen joint</p>

<h2>Saturday, July 16</h2>
<p>I beat my first song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild")! Has been
a big goal of mine the past month -- slowly reaffirming my belief that I
can achieve anything I want to in life.</p>
<p>Other goals I have that are self-belief affirming</p>
<ul>
<li>Ollie up a curb</li>
<li>Creating a short animated music video</li>
<li>Creating an original piano + guitar arrangement of a favorite song
and uploading to YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>Spent two hours relearning how to draw figures on an iPad. Gonna
relearn how to draw heads on the iPad over the next few days</p>
<p>Went to a college frat party with JW, my first!</p>
<ul>
<li>"What's been on your mind lately? Where's your head been at?" is a
great conversation opener with guys, but doesn't seem to work well as
often with gals.</li>
<li>Compared to tech parties, everybody is gloriously average and just
wants to get drunk and talk / laugh</li>
<li>I did drunk sketches of cute girls and showed them the pic as an
icebreaker. Naturally led to fun conversations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Friday, July 15</h2>
<p>Got a 12.9 inch iPad Pro with a pencil! Am very excited to be able to
draw digitally: color, easy undo, and layers</p>
<p>JW arrived at my place in the evening, he's gonna be staying with me
for the next week</p>
<h2>Thursday, July 14</h2>
<p>DH invited me to see
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFRdoYfZYUY">Hania Rani</a>,
one of my favorite pianists, live. For over an hour she looped and
switched between three pianos -- seeing one person create all that music
live was inspiring.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, July 13</h2>
<p>Went to a dinner party</p>
<h2>Tuesday, July 12</h2>
<p>Interviewed a candidate for Numerai. It was clear that he hasn't
coded much the past two years (was promoted to manager), and right after
I sent in my feedback the rest of his interviews were cancelled. Feels
strange to wield this much impact over another's life.</p>
<p>Went to my first stand-up comedy show with MP -- very fun time, and I
have so much more respect for what they do now, I couldn't imagine doing
comedy improve live with so much pressure.</p>
<h2>Monday, July 11</h2>
<p>Flew back from Vegas to SF. Got on the plane 5 minutes for
takeoff</p>
<p>Talked with AY for a few hours in the evening and did a review of
sorts of life since we met last November.</p>
<h1>July, Week 1</h1>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>RC's birthday in Vegas</p>
<p>Drew 130 boxes over 13 hours</p>
<p>Realized that I'm at the peak of a life that I do not want to
live</p>
<h2>Sunday, July 10</h2>
<p>Woke up in the Elvis suite, swam in the pool for a bit, played piano
while private jet guy played saxophone, and ate breakfast served by the
suite's butler.</p>
<p>Talked with CL while eating tacos for lunch. Was nice to hear that
the casual drug usage on display at all of the Numerai parties I've been
to is much more extreme than anything else he's seen while working</p>
<p>Drew a scene of Venice -- was my first time drawing for fun instead
of a study. I enjoyed it, and decided to buy an iPad pro. Am excited to
be able to draw in high fidelity with vibrant colors in any cafe.</p>
<h2>Saturday, July 9</h2>
<p>In Vegas for RC's birthday party</p>
<ul>
<li>Private jet with live saxophone</li>
<li>Front row seats at Cirque du Soleil (Michael Jackson One)</li>
<li>Party at the penthouse of Westgate, the suite where Elvis used to
live</li>
<li>Afterparty at RT's house, interior design was what every kid dreams
of</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a dozen times tonight where in the middle of talking to
someone they'd do a line of coke.</p>
<p>I'm on the peak of a mountain that I do not want to be on</p>
<p>I do not want to be around these people, talk about money, or do
drugs</p>
<p>Met EC, got the sense she was dissatisfied with her finance job.
She's like me at a similar stage in life, but more advanced in every way
(salary, art skill, education level etc)</p>
<p>I want to live a life and be around people where I can be completely
honest with what I'm thinking about and who I am.</p>
<h2>Friday, July 8</h2>
<p>Played DDR for an hour and came within inches of beating a song on
the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild")</p>
<p>This past week I've spent 13 hours drawing 130 boxes in an attempt to
improve my skill at perspective. Normally I draw at home with music on,
but tonight I listened to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZhLzt__lcc">a video</a>
suggesting that only doing drawing studies isn't the best -- a large
amount of drawing what you love is great to try out different styles,
apply what you've learnt in studies, and nurture your soul.</p>
<p>I'm gonna carve out an hour every morning to draw for fun.</p>
<h2>Thursday, July 7</h2>
<p>Every other Thursday Numerai has a massage therapist come into the
office and give everyone the most wonderful 30 minute massage.</p>
<p>Today she commented on how the shape of my back and its muscles have
changed over the past month from me rock climbing.</p>
<p>It's strange to have someone know your body better than your
mind.</p>
<h2>Wednesday, June 6</h2>
<p>Really enjoying DDR. Am consistently beating the hardest songs on
"Hard". Gonna try and beat a song on the highest SMX difficulty ("Wild")
this week, which is crazy since this was on my short list of goals in
life last month.</p>
<p>Managed to fit in 2.5 hours of drawing boxes during 5 hours of work
meetings.</p>
<h2>Tuesday, July 5</h2>
<p>I'm happy keeping the number of people I'm close to small, since no
matter how busy life is I can always be there for them</p>
<h2>Monday, July 4</h2>
<p>Broke up with Nancy two days ago. Despite not finding a life partner
I still wouldn't have done anything differently. Committing to a
relationship quickly when I feel a spark is what I'll continue doing in
the future -- even if things go south it's alright since I'm honest
throughout and feel fine breaking things off when I know it won't work
out.</p>
<p>Numerai rented a sailboat to watch the Independence day fireworks.
Out on the Bay the fireworks were so close that they filled my entire
field of view.</p>
<h1>June, Week 5</h1>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned my website</li>
<li>Terminated my lease</li>
<li><a href="/art-home-school/perspective-1-week-1.html">Completed
perspective 1 week 1</a></li>
<li>Played a lot of DDR</li>
<li>Learned how to ollie</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel much more emotionally well and stable than I did last year</p>
<h2>Sunday, July 3</h2>
<p>Today was my ideal day: drawing, cooking, skateboarding, talking with
AY, and DDR.</p>
<p>Thinking about how I haven't really watched any TV shows / movies,
played many games, or read much fiction the past few months -- usually
in pursuit of being productive in my free-time.</p>
<p>Letting more quality long-form art and entertainment into my life is
important for inspiration. Am most interested in media with unique art
styles, interaction mechanisms that enhance immersion, and worlds /
characters with depth.</p>
<h2>Saturday, July 2</h2>
<p>Coworked via Discord with Alex Honeycutt, the creator of the self
study art curriculum I've been following the past two months.</p>
<p>Last week DR mentioned that he considered his attempt to self-study
math the past year a failure, because there were often months where he
felt intellectually isolated and didn't get anything done as a
result.</p>
<p>It was nice talking to and co-existing with another person who left
tech to pursue art. I'm gonna continue putting effort into making art
friends and contributing to little corners of the internet.</p>
<h2>Friday, July 1</h2>
<p>Went to In n Out with JP, talked about how he's feeling burnt as a
solo founder, and my essay on why I'm doing art.</p>
<p>I often say "I'm doing art because I like it". There's a lot more
nuance to my thoughts, and my joke response is probably indicative of
some insecurity</p>
<p>He likes the crackhead energy of dropping everything to pursue what
feels right.</p>
<p>"I probably won't make much money as an artists" -- he doesn't
believe this to be true as long as I apply a bit of tech thinking: high
agency and aiming for the heavy tail</p>
<h2>Thursday, June 30</h2>
<p>Got to catch up with DH for the first time in months at the Numerai
office party</p>
<ul>
<li>Midjourney and the future of illustrators and concept artists</li>
<li>Me leaving Numerai because I'm young and want to explore more of
life. Was nice to have a mentor say that my plan "makes sense"</li>
<li>Him encouraging me to go to Japan / Berlin instead of holing up in
Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrote <a href="/art-home-school/head-anatomy-1-week-3.html">head
anatomy 1 week 3 update</a></p>
<h2>Wednesday, June 29</h2>
<p>AY recently redesigned their website, which inspired me to revamp
mine as well.</p>
<p>Chia and 100R's personal websites have been my favorite for a long
time. I've borrowed their multi-column layouts and more prolific vibe
for this new site.</p>
<p>Screenshots of my previous and redesigned website</p>
<p>MP told me what him and RC felt that they were missing in life, and
asked what I feel I'm lacking in. I wonder if he has a hunch that I'm
leaving</p>
<h2>Tuesday, June 28</h2>
<p>AY's response to me feeling guilty about leaving was "I think they'd
want you to leave and follow your dreams". It's a nice sentiment, but I
think the subtext here is "don't you dare wuss out of this"</p>
<p>This subtext was a nice push to finally email my landlord and request
to terminate my lease and move out on Aug 5, the day I fly out for
NYC.</p>
<p>Things are in motion that cannot be undone.</p>
<h2>Monday, June 27</h2>
<p>Numerai company onsite this week! Half of our team is remote -- it's
nice to have everyone together.</p>
<p>Went to our COO's house and went on a hike, had a pool party, and ate
lunch from a taco truck guy.</p>
<p>It was a nice day, but also good to remember that working away at a
hedge fund to afford all this isn't my goal in life.</p>
<p>Felt guilty about having fun with coworkers, knowing that I'll soon
leave and break everyone's hearts.</p>
