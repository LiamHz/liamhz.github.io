<h2>Monday, June 27</h2>
<p>
Numerai company onsite this week! Half of our team is remote -- it's nice to have everyone together.
<p>
Went to our COO's house and went on a hike, had a pool party, and ate lunch from a taco truck guy.

<p>
It was a nice day, but also good to remember that working away at a hedge fund to afford all this isn't my goal in life.

<p>
Felt guilty about having fun with coworkers, knowing that I'll soon leave and break everyone's hearts.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Tuesday, June 28</h2>
<p>
AY's response to me feeling guilty about leaving was "I think they'd want you to leave and follow your dreams". It's a nice sentiment, but I think the subtext here is "don't you dare wuss out of this"  

<p>
This subtext was a nice push to finally email my landlord and request to terminate my lease and move out on Aug 5, the day I fly out for NYC.  

<p>
Things are in motion that cannot be undone.

<h2>Wednesday, June 29</h2>
<p>
AY recently redesigned their website, which inspired me to revamp mine as well.

<p>
Chia and 100R's personal websites have been my favorite for a long time. I've borrowed their multi-column layouts and more prolific vibe for this new site.

<p>
Screenshots of my previous and redesigned website

<p>
MP told me what him and RC felt that they were missing in life, and asked what I feel I'm lacking in. I wonder if he has a hunch that I'm leaving
</p>

<h2>Thursday, June 30</h2>
<p>
Got to catch up with DH for the first time in months at the Numerai office party

<ul>
<li>Midjourney and the future of illustrators and concept artists
<li>Me leaving Numerai because I'm young and want to explore more of life. Was nice to have a mentor say that my plan "makes sense"
<li>Him encouraging me to go to Japan / Berlin instead of holing up in Canada
</ul>

<h2>Friday, July 1</h2>
<p>
Went to In n Out with JP, talked about how he's feeling burnt as a solo founder, and my essay on why I'm doing art.

<p>
I often say "I'm doing art because I like it". There's a lot more nuance to my thoughts, and my joke response is probably indicative of some insecurity

<p>
He likes the crackhead energy of dropping everything to pursue what feels right.

<p>
"I probably won't make much money as an artists" -- he doesn't believe this to be true as long as I apply a bit of tech thinking: high agency and aiming for the heavy tail
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>Saturday, July 2</h2>
<p>
Coworked via Discord with Alex Honeycutt, the creator of the self study art curriculum I've been following the past two months.

<p>
Last week DR mentioned that he considered his attempt to self-study math the past year a failure, because there were often months where he felt intellectually isolated and didn't get anything done as a result.

<p>
It was nice talking to and co-existing with another person who left tech to pursue art. I'm gonna continue putting effort into making art friends and contributing to little corners of the internet.

<h2>Sunday, July 3</h2>
<p>
Today was my ideal day: drawing, cooking, skateboarding, talking with AY, and DDR.

<p>
Thinking about how I haven't really watched any TV shows / movies, played many games, or read much fiction the past few months -- usually in pursit of being productive in my free-time.

<p>
Letting more quality long-form art and entertainment into my life is important for inspiration. Am most interested in media with unique art styles, interaction mechanisms that enhance immersion, and worlds / characters with depth.
</div>
<div class="column">
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned my website
<li>Terminated my lease
<li>Completed perspective 1 week 1
<li>Played a lot of DDR
<li>Learned how to ollie
</ul>

<p>
I feel much more emotionally well and stable than I did last year
