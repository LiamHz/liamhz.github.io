### July - September
- Girlfriend
	- Watched Avatar The Last Airbender together

## Reflections & Learnings
### Success & Growth
**What am I most proud of personally and professionally?**
- In July and August I got a ton of computer graphics work done, created polished articles and projects, and got external recognition of the quality of my work. This should be the standard I hold myself to whenever I dive into new fields from now on.
- Dropping out of university was something I had known I should do for a while, and I'm proud that I actually followed through on what made sense to do.
- Getting hired at Numerai, and being able to navigate through many other competing interviews and offers.

**What new skills and/or habits did I develop?**
- Practicing piano. I had stopped for over a year since I stopped lessons
- Exercising. I've been consistent about this for the past four months
- Journaling. I'll have off weeks, and it's evolved for the better over time, but for the most part I've been consistent since May

**How am I different?**
I'm harder, better, faster, stronger compared to other people my age

### Falling Short
**What goals didn't I accomplish? What got in the way?**
I didn't follow through on several goals
- Reading --> Aimed for 26 books, read 16
- Self-study --> Didn't thoroughly work through any textbooks
- Broadening intellectual breadth --> I'm still mainly a compsci guy

All of these were caused by not having weekly / monthly reviews, and not having personal OKRs. This, when combined with quarantine, led to me not getting much done from January through June of 2020 since I didn't have cues to course correct.

### People & Relationships
I'm really happy that my first romantic relationship was with an amazing person, lasted for 11 months, and ended on good terms for reasons outside of our control.

I did everything I could to make friends while at university, kept an open-mind on people, and spent time with everybody. Unfortunately, among the 50 people in residence, there wasn't anybody who was driven.

Moving to New Mexico for two months was one of the best decisions I made this year. Everybody there was amazing. I made a few friends that I think will come back into my life again, got job offers and intros to companies (2 of which I ended up working for!), and will probably live at Stanford next September with one of the people.

### Health & Wellness
Exercising via resistance bands and the rowing machine has been consistent for the past four months.

I have a set of habits that keep my mental health strong (walk, write, socialize, reflect, read). Unfortunately, these get neglected when I'm not feeling great for whatever reason, including now.

Stress from uncertainty and loneliness are what cause me to not feel good.

### Lessons & Themes
**What were my top lessons learned?**
- How I spend my time is completely under my control (e.g. dropping out, where to work, free time)
- My growth trajectory is good, but my social circle (who I compare myself to) will constantly "level up" (e.g. university --> New Mexico and MFC --> Numerai)

**How do you describe this year in 3-5 keywords?**
January to June --> Stagnant
July to December --> Rapid change and growth

**What am I most thankful for?**
- Getting to be in an amazing relationship
- Getting to go to New Mexico, meet amazing people, and have my life trajectory accelerated
- Getting to work at Numerai as my first full-time job. They're the [coolest company I know of](https://twitter.com/LiamHinzman/status/1341064191688364032?s=20)

## Current Life Assessment
Score your level of satisfaction in each area of life from 1 (highly unsatisfied) to 10 (couldn't get any better).

Identify what you want to focus on.

### Health
**How does your body and mind feel?**
5/10. The past two weeks I haven't been exercising much, and overall I've been feeling pretty lonely in SF without in-person contact. MFC and poker nights have been good.

I think if I get back on the wagon with daily habits, mainly exercising and journaling, I'll get back to 8/10 and be able to make it through the next 5 months of quarantine relatively happy.

### Family & Friends
**How do you feel about the quality of relationships in your life?**
7/10. I'm happy with all of the relationships in my life, but I'm sad that I can't see people in person.

### Love
**How do you feel about romance in your life?**
6/10. It's a bit... confusing right now. I still miss my ex a lot and think about her frequently. But yesterday (January 2nd), I kissed a girl for the first time since I broke up with my ex. I'm not sure on how I want this new relationship to develop.

### Money
**How do you feel about your financial situation?**
9/10. Numerai could be paying me a bit more, but I expect a substantial raise after I finish my first year. Since I'm living at the founder's place, I'm not having to pay rent in SF and probably won't have to for the next 3 months or so. Overall I'm feeling pretty wealthy.
	
### Career
**How do you feel about work and your career trajectory?**
9/10. Numerai has a very high quality engineering culture, and I'm getting lots of opportunities to prove my worth and learn a lot.

### Spirituality
**Are you connected to something bigger and greater than yourself?**
idk/10. I don't feel connected to anything bigger than myself, but that doesn't feel too important to me right now, although I could see that changing in a years time.

### Personal Growth
**How much time do you invest in self-improvement?**

### Fun
**How much time do you devote to recreation and fun?**
4/10. Most of my free time is pretty unsatisfying right now. Reading and watching anime has been alright though, but I'd like a bit more variety here. I think things will improve significantly after the digital piano I ordered arrives later this week.

### Technology
9/10. I'm a hacker mans. Probably could spend a bit less time surfing Reddit and YouTube, but this usually goes down on its own when I have projects and self-study going.
	
### Environment
**How do you feel about your physical environment?**
7/10. I'm living in the Numerai founder's house by myself right now. It's an amazing place. Wish I was living with other people though.
	
### Reflections
**How do I feel about my life when I look at the areas of life above?**

**Which 2-3 dimensions do I want to focus on in 2021?**
2021, January to June
1. Career (Numerai)
2. Personal Growth (Self-study, reading, writing)
3. Fun (piano)

2022, July to December
1. Love (My ex will probably live with me during the summer)
